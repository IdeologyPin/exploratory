VWASHINGTON (AP) - President Barack Obama's plan to strengthen controls on guns in the U.S. is meeting swift resistance from gun rights groups, Republicans and even a few Democrats who say it's up to Congress to enact new policies on firearms. Yet the overall effect on gun violence could prove to be relatively small. \u000aSome questions and answers about Obama's presidential actions on gun control: \u000aWHAT ACTION IS OBAMA TAKING? \u000aObama announced a 10-point plan to try to keep guns from people who shouldn't have them. The centerpiece is new federal guidance that seeks to clarify who is "in the business" of selling firearms and has to get a federal license. \u000aLicensed dealers must run background checks on prospective buyers, but private sellers don't. Obama is aiming to narrow that loophole so that more firearms sold at gun shows, flea markets or online are subject to background checks. \u000aOther steps include 230 new examiners the FBI will hire to process background checks. And Obama is directing federal agencies to research smart gun technology to reduce accidental shootings and asking Congress for $500 million for mental health care. Further steps aim to better track lost guns and prevent trusts or corporations from buying dangerous weapons without background checks. \u000aI SELL A FEW GUNS FROM TIME TO TIME. DO I NEED TO REGISTER? \u000aThere's no cut-and-dry answer. \u000aThe new guidance says if your "principal motive" is profit, you're a dealer, but if you occasionally sell guns from your personal collection, you're not. Someone who only sells at gun shows or online can still be a dealer. \u000aThere's no specific number of guns that triggers a requirement to register. But the Justice Department is warning sellers that courts have convicted people for dealing without a license even when they've sold as few as two guns. \u000aIt's up to individuals to look at the guidance and determine whether they need a license. The penalties for making the wrong call are steep: up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for those who deal firearms without a license. If you're not sure, you can contact the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \u000aWOULD THIS HAVE STOPPED RECENT MASS SHOOTINGS? \u000aAn Associated Press review shows that Obama's executive actions would have had no impact in keeping weapons from suspects in several of the deadliest incidents, including Newtown, Connecticut; San Bernardino, California; and Aurora, Colorado. The shooters in Newtown and San Bernardino, for example, used weapons purchased by other people. \u000aObama's actions could potentially reduce other gun deaths - especially suicides, which cause two-thirds of gun deaths. But it's unclear whether the steps will significantly curb unregulated gun sales. \u000aMillions of guns are sold annually in informal settings outside of gun shops, including many through private sales arranged online. The Obama administration acknowledged it couldn't quantify how many gun sales would be newly subjected to background checks. Nor could it say how many currently unregistered gun sellers would have to obtain a license. \u000aObama is running out of time. With barely a year left in his presidency, he has to act quickly to roll out new policies, especially if he wants them to become ingrained and harder to rescind when the next president takes over. \u000aAfter the Newtown shooting, Obama in 2013 sought far-reaching, bipartisan legislation that went beyond background checks to ban certain assault-style weapons and cap the size of ammunition clips. When the effort collapsed in the Senate, the White House said it was working to identify every legal step he could take on his own. \u000aBut a more recent spate of gun-related atrocities, including in San Bernardino, California, spurred the administration to give the issue another look. \u000aCAN THE PRESIDENT DO THIS ALONE? \u000aObama says he can. Republicans and gun rights advocates say he can't. \u000aThe White House says Obama is acting fully within his legal authority, by clarifying existing laws that Congress has already passed. It's an argument Obama has used before when opposition in Congress has led him to take sweeping executive action on immigration, climate change and other issues. \u000aStill, Obama readily concedes the executive steps will be challenged in court. One likely option for opponents is to challenge Obama's authority to define what it means to be "engaged in the business" of selling guns, since that definition isn't laid out in the law. \u000a

VWASHINGTON (AP) - President Barack Obama's move to tighten controls on guns could curb the unregulated buying and selling of weapons over the Internet and at gun shows. But the overall effect on violence in the U.S. could prove to be modest. \u000a"It's not ever going to be difficult to get a firearm, just like it's not ever going to be difficult to get illegal drugs," said James Jacobs, a New York University law school professor. "What makes us think that we can now create a regime that will make guns hard to obtain for someone who wants to obtain them?" \u000aThe president used his executive authority Tuesday to clarify that anyone "in the business" of selling firearms must obtain a federal license and conduct background checks on prospective buyers, regardless of where the sales take place. Currently, many private sellers online and at gun shows do not bother to get licenses, and weapons sales over the Internet have become a booming business. \u000aThe White House and others can't say how many transactions the step will block or how much bloodshed it may prevent. \u000aBut the new controls probably wouldn't have prevented several of the grisly mass shootings around the country that have led to demands for tighter gun laws, and may affect only a fraction of the nation's 30,000 annual gun deaths. \u000aThe president's action "has potential impact - the degree or the type, it's hard to predict," said University of Pennsylvania professor Susan Sorenson, who studies violence prevention. "And it's really important to acknowledge that we can't just have one change and expect that to change things wildly." \u000aFor one thing, studies have shown that criminals are more likely to get guns directly from friends or other social connections than at gun shows or flea markets. \u000aThe president also called for the hiring of more than 230 additional examiners and other staff to process the millions of background checks received annually. But even with added manpower, there's no way to completely eliminate human error like the clerical mistakes that allowed Dylann Roof, the young man charged in the Charleston, South Carolina, church massacre, to buy a weapon even though he should have been disqualified after an earlier drug arrest. \u000aThe White House did not set a threshold for the number of guns someone has to sell to be covered by the licensing and background check requirement. But it warned that people can be charged with a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison for selling as few as two firearms when there is evidence they are running a business, such as selling weapons in their original packaging and for a profit. \u000aTheresa O'Rourke of Downers Grove, Illinois, said she hopes Obama's action will deter illegal transactions that have deadly consequences. Her best friend, 36-year-old Jitka Vesel, was killed in 2011 by a stalker who had illegally purchased a gun from a seller he met through Armslist.com, an online gun site. The seller was sentenced to prison after pleading guilty to an illegal sale. \u000a"People do it now because it's easy," O'Rourke said. "But if we say upfront that if you break the law and you are going to go to prison, most people are going to take a step back and say, 'You know what? It's not worth it.'" \u000aShe and other gun control advocates said too many individuals make a living selling guns without obtaining the $150 license and following requirements to conduct background checks, keep detailed sales records and face federal inspections. \u000aPrivate sales - often carried out in person after Internet advertisements connect sellers and buyers - can be exploited by convicted felons, domestic abusers and others who cannot pass a background check, critics say. \u000aPrivate sales have increasingly gone online over the last decade, but precise data is hard to pin down. GunBroker.com, which calls itself the world's largest online auction site for firearms and accessories, says it has grown every year since 1999. It now boasts 750,000 active listings on any given day. Armslist claims 7 million site visits per month. \u000aOne in 20 guns advertised through Armslist last year was linked to an unlicensed seller who had listed at least 25 guns, according to recent research published by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group backed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. A 2013 investigation by that group's predecessor, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, found that more than 3 percent of potential buyers on Armslist had criminal records that would bar them from owning firearms. \u000aArmslist, which was founded after Craigslist banned gun ads in 2007, says in a disclaimer on its website that it doesn't get involved in transactions and that buyers and sellers must follow all state and federal gun laws. Still, guns sold through ads on the site have been linked to some fatal shootings. \u000aA lawsuit filed in October alleges that an abusive husband purchased a handgun through an Armslist ad and used it to kill his wife and two other women at a salon in suburban Milwaukee in 2012. The man, Radcliffe Haughton, was able to buy the gun even though a judge had issued a restraining order days earlier that should have made him ineligible. He went online to say he was "looking to buy ASAP," and made the purchase in the parking lot of a McDonald's, the lawsuit says. \u000aArmslist owner Jonathan Gibbon called Obama's moves "well-meaning but ultimately ineffective." He said many private sellers want to conduct background checks but are discouraged by a "costly and burdensome" system that requires them to go to licensed dealers and pay fees. \u000a"Further scrutiny of law-abiding people will not stop criminals," he said. \u000aEverytown president John Feinblatt called the clarification a welcome if modest step. \u000a"It puts them on notice and, if accompanied with aggressive enforcement, has the potential to narrow the number of unlicensed dealers who are selling without background checks," he said. "But even so, millions of guns will be sold online without background checks unless Congress or states pass universal background checks, as 18 states have done on their own." \u000aThe Obama administration appeared determined to tamp down expectations, with Obama saying he realizes his actions won't stop all gun violence. \u000a"Obviously the president is not able to take strong measures because that's going to require Congress to act," said Philip Cook, a Duke University professor. "But if he is able to disrupt a relative handful of sales and save a handful of lives, that may well be worthwhile." \u000aHe added: "What we're looking at here is a low-cost intervention with the possibility of some payoff." \u000a

V"The problem is some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules. A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked." \u000a\u2014 President Obama, remarks on gun proposals, Jan. 5, 2016 \u000aThe Fact Checker's inbox just about exploded after the president made this comment in introducing new guidance for background checks and gun-safety proposals. \u000aWe will leave aside the question about whether the president's announcement would make much difference \u2013 some experts are dubious \u2013 and look at this specific question: Is there a separate set of rules for the Internet? \u000aThe president referred to the Internet but, broadly speaking, he was talking about electronic commerce. E-commerce is the buying and selling of goods and services, or the transmitting of funds or data, over an electronic network, such as the Internet. \u000aSo this definition includes not just 130,000 gun dealers which hold a Federal Firearms License (FFL) that might sell goods over the Internet, but also online sales forums, such as Armslist. \u000aA gun dealer must comply with federal laws which requires gun sellers to have licenses and perform background checks based upon whether they are "engaged in the business" of selling firearms, without regard for whether the sale is arranged on the Internet or in person. \u000aA private transaction arranged by a buyer and seller on an online forum such Armslist- "the largest free gun classifieds on the web"- is somewhat different. \u000aAny transaction across state lines still must be processed by an FFL in the home state of the buyer -which would conduct a background check. This was mandated in the Arms Control Act of 1968. \u000aBut if both the buyer and seller reside in the same state, then it becomes a transaction between two private individuals, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Private sellers are not required to see identification, keep records or conduct a background check. (Note: this is at the federal level. Eight states \u2013 California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state \u2013 and the District of Columbia require background checks for all private sales, while Maryland and Pennsylvania require it for private handgun sales.) \u000aThese private sales are almost always going to take place in person, because shipping a gun is subject to various restrictions. \u000aA Justice Department official provided the following example: "A person could post on a gun-for-sale website, get paid through PayPal, and then deliver the firearm at a public space. So long as both buyer and seller are residents of the same state, that transaction is lawful." \u000aHe added: "It is unlawful for the felon to do so, because their receipt of the firearm is illegal. But the seller hasn't done anything wrong if the seller doesn't know that the buyer is prohibited." \u000aThe New York Times, in a 2013 article, asserted that "Armslist and similar sites function as unregulated bazaars, where the essential anonymity of the Internet allows unlicensed sellers to advertise scores of weapons and people legally barred from gun ownership to buy them." Armlist, for its part, says "many, if not most, private sellers want to do background checks" but they find having to pay a fee to an FFL burdensome. \u000aAdministration officials say the president was also referring the so-called "dark web," which lies beyond the public Internet and which requires software or authorization to access. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch told reporters on Jan. 4 that the ATF was planning to step up enforcement in "not just the Internet that we all access through regular stores' websites, but also the dark web, the Internet not accessible to the average consumer where illicit transactions, including those involving firearms, go on." \u000aIn November 2015, for instance, an Alabama man was sentenced to 51 months in prison for unlawfully selling and shipped at least 32 firearms to people all over the world \u2013 including Australia and Sweden -via the dark web. \u000aThis is a difficult claim to assess because a lot depends on how one reads Obama's remarks: "The problem is some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules. A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked." \u000aAdministration officials say his point was that electronic commerce has made it easier for prohibited people such as felons to obtain firearms (or to hide such transactions from scrutiny behind the dark Web). Put in those terms, his statement is reasonable. Illegal markets often exploit new forms of commerce. \u000aBut many readers believed Obama was asserting the rules were different for the Internet \u2013 that it legally permitted violent felons to obtain guns. \u000aWe agree that Obama's language is slippery and could be confusing to the average person who doesn't know anything about FFLs and state requirements. There is nothing unique about the Internet; the laws governing private transactions and interstate sales are exactly the same. It's the same as offering to sell a gun on a bulletin board, except the bulletin board is significantly larger. The Internet, and payment systems such as PayPal, have certainly facilitated transactions that in the past would have been more difficult to arrange. \u000aObama erred in saying the rules are different for Internet sellers. They face the same rules as other sellers \u2013 rules that the administration now says it will enforce better. \u000a

VWashington \u2014 Jewish groups praised new executive actions by President Barack Obama to reduce gun violence. \u000aOn Tuesday, in an emotional White House address accompanied by victims of gun violence, Obama announced a series of measures that include broadening the definition of a business under existing gun control laws, addressing loopholes that allow some gun sellers to skirt background check requirements; making gun sellers more accountable for guns that are lost or stolen while in their possession; increasing support for the development of gun safety technology, and increasing funds for mental health. \u000a\u201cToday, background checks are required at gun stores \u2014 if a father wants to teach his daughter how to hunt, he can walk into a gun store, get a background check, purchase his weapon safely and responsibly,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe problem is some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules. A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked.\u201d \u000aRepresentatives of the National Council of Jewish Women , Jewish Women International and the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, the umbrella body for Jewish public policy groups, were present at the announcement of the initiatives. They were among an array of groups including the Reform movement\u2019s Religious Action Center and its Central Conference of American Rabbis that praised the actions. \u000aWith his executive actions, Obama is directing federal agencies to take the steps he proposed. \u000a\u201cThese proposals are a step forward,\u201d said Jared Feldman, the JCPA\u2019s Washington director. \u201cThey are clearly insufficient to the magnitude of the problem. We\u2019re going to need Congress to engage \u2014 and engage substantively \u2014 on these issues.\u201d \u000aObama has failed to advance gun-control legislation through the Republican-led Congress. Republican leaders suggested in statements Tuesday that his actions were unconstitutional, and several of the party\u2019s presidential candidates said they would roll back the actions as soon as they were elected. \u000aThe president wiped away tears as he recalled the 2012 massacre of first-graders in Newtown, Connecticut, by a lone gunman. \u000a\u201cEvery time I think about those kids it gets me madder,\u201d Obama said. \u000aAmong those on hand for the announcement was Gabrielle Giffords, the former Jewish Arizona congresswoman who survived a shooting attack in a Tucson suburb in 2011. Since then, the Jewish lawmaker has led advocacy for gun control. \u000aThe National Council of Jewish Women, which has been advocating for gun control since 1969, would continue to work on the state level, said its CEO, Nancy Kaufman. \u000a\u201cWe still hold out hope the Congress will understand they need to do something,\u201d she said, but added that the most effective route now seemed to be to advance background checks and gun trafficking on the state level. \u000a

VPresident Barack Obama\u2019s proposed executive actions on gun violence were met with mixed reactions from Illinois politicians on Tuesday. Unsurprisingly, opposition and support for the measures fell along party lines. \u000aFollowing Obama\u2019s address to the nation, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., held a press conference with Ald. Willie Cochran (20th) in Englewood, one of Chicago\u2019s most crime-ridden neighborhoods, during which they praised the president\u2019s steps to strengthen and enforce gun laws. \u000aDurbin pointed out that Chicago led the U.S. in gun deaths with 468 in 2015, and that the number of shooting victims increased 13 percent over the year to a record 2,939. \u000a\u201cGo to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as I did just a few months ago. Ask them the following question: When you go to the most violent sections of the city of Chicago \u2014 where the most gun incidents and crimes are taking place and you gather the crime guns and check out where they came from \u2014 what do you find? Forty percent of the crime guns in the deadliest sections of Chicago come from gun shows in northwestern Indiana,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cWhy? There\u2019s no background check. They sell these guns in volumes and they sell ammunition. These gangsters fill up the trunks of their car, drive across the state line into the city of Chicago and you know what happens next. They are sold to anyone who can put the money up for the purchase and then they turn into deadly weapons.\u201d \u000aRepublican U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk on Sunday, before Obama unveiled his plan, seemed to avoid the partisan divide, saying in a tweet, \u201cThis year I supported keeping guns from suspected terrorists & called on POTUS to look at social media in background checks.\u201d \u000aHere\u2019s a list of statements from other Illinois politicians -- mostly congressmen who represent the suburbs and Chicago -- on Obama\u2019s gun control plans. See what your U.S. representative had to say. \u000a

VPolicies surrounding lawfully owning and selling guns in the U.S. changed this week, following President Barack Obama\u2019s executive action Tuesday on background checks and regulations for firearms dealers. For starters, background checks are now federally mandated for sales over the internet and at gun shows. Previously, 17 states required background checks for these transactions. \u000aAlthough Obama\u2019s announcement raised concerns among gun rights advocates, the executive orders only expand existing procedures spelled out in a guide published in 2014 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The agency last year encouraged federal firearms licensees, or FFLs, to assist with private-party sales or ownership transfers of firearms. \u000aNow, under risk of breaking the law, private parties must seek out a licensed dealer or become licensed themselves in order to conduct the proper background checks before a sale or transfer. Only licensed gun dealers can access the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, according to the federal guide. \u000aThe following procedure must be followed for all online and gun show transactions: \u000a(1) The prospective [buyer] must complete Section A of a Firearms Transaction Record, ATF Form 4473 ; \u000a(2) The [licensed dealer] must complete Section B of the Form 4473, conduct a [background check] on the [buyer], and record the response; \u000a(3) The [licensed deals] must record the words \u201cPrivate Party Transfer\u201d on the ATF Form 4473, Item 30c; and \u000a(4) The [licensed dealer] must maintain the Form 4473 in accordance with [the law] \u2026 [and] ensure it can be determined which transaction records correspond with private party [sales] in the [dealer\u2019s Acquisition and Disposition] record \u2026 \u000aThe ATF\u2019s guide goes on to explain what licensed firearms dealers should do when the background check process returns a \u201cdenied\u201d or \u201cdelayed\u201d decision for the prospective transaction. The above law was established under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993. After its original adoption, the act applied only to handgun sales. In 1998, a permanent provision went into effect requiring background checks on long guns such as shotguns and rifles, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. \u000a

VPresident Obama\u2019s passionate address to the nation on Tuesday outlined four major executive actions he and his administration will take to address gun safety. This follows Congress\u2019 many failed attempts to agree upon and pass legislation intended to expand background checks for gun purchases and otherwise make obtaining firearms more difficult for those identified as dangerous threats. One of the highlights from his address is an order to several federal agencies to conduct or sponsor research into safer gun technology \u2013 including \u201csmart guns.\u201d \u000aThe Departments of Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security have been instructed to move forward with this research, which includes regularly reviewing the latest available technology. The departments have 90 days to produce a report on their findings, including how to realistically incorporate gun safety technology into the market. The White House\u2019s executive action fact sheet notes the US Federal Government is the largest domestic purchaser of firearms and \u201chas a unique opportunity to advance this research and ensure that smart gun technology becomes a reality.\u201d \u000aRelated: Philadelphia becomes first US city to ban 3D-printed guns \u000a\u201cSmart gun\u201d technology could mean many different things, yet the main purpose of implementing these features is preventing accidental injuries and deaths from improper use of firearms. By using technology that could prevent anyone but the gun owner from operating the firearm, the number of tragic gun deaths should drop. President Obama puts it simply: \u201cWe can set it up so you can\u2019t unlock your phone unless you\u2019ve got the right fingerprint. Why can\u2019t we do the same thing for our guns?\u201d \u000a

VPresident Barack Obama unveiled an array of measures on Tuesday tightening control and enforcement of firearms in the U.S., using his presidential powers in the absence of legal changes he implored Congress to pass. \u000aObama accused the gun lobby of taking Congress hostage, but said "they cannot hold America hostage." He insisted it was possible to uphold the Second Amendment while doing something to tackle the frequency of mass shootings in the U.S. that he said had become "the new normal." \u000aObama wiped tears from his cheeks as he spoke emotionally about the victims of gun violence. \u000a"This is not a plot to take away everybody's guns," Obama said in a ceremony in the East Room. "You pass a background check, you purchase a firearm. The problem is some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules." \u000aAt the centerpiece of Obama's plan is a more sweeping definition of gun dealers that the administration hopes will expand the number of sales subject to background checks. Under current law, only federally licensed gun dealers must conduct background checks on buyers. But at gun shows, websites and flea markets, sellers often skirt that requirement by declining to register as licensed dealers. So new federal guidance from the Obama administration clarified that it applies to anyone "in the business" of selling firearms. \u000aThe White House also put sellers on notice that the administration planned to strengthen enforcement \u2014 including deploying 230 new examiners the FBI will hire to process background checks. \u000aTo lend a personal face to the issue, the White House assembled a cross-section of Americans whose lives were altered by the nation's most searing recent gun tragedies, including former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and relatives of victims from Charleston, S.C., at Virginia Tech. Mark Barden, whose son was shot to death at Sandy Hook Elementary School, introduced the president with a declaration that "we are better than this." \u000aInvoking the words of Martin Luther King Jr., Obama said, "We need to feel the fierce urgency of now." \u000a

VHouston Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee joined President Barack Obama's push for new gun curbs Wednesday, introducing bills putting money and resources behind his calls for more mental health treatment and beefed up background checks for firearms purchases. \u000aOne measure would provide $500 million for mental health programs, including the reporting of disqualifying mental health information to the FBI's background check system. \u000aThe other authorizes the hiring of 200 additional ATF agents and investigators to help process background checks and enforce existing gun laws. \u000aObama included these specific requests in a new gun control initiative he announced Tuesday during an emotional appearance surrounded by shooting victims and their relatives. \u000aThe president's executive orders also would launch new research into smart gun technology and require gun dealers to report lost or stolen weapons. \u000aCongressional Republicans, however, have shown no interest in the White House plan, which conservatives deride as an assault on Americans' Second Amendment gun rights. \u000a"The President's commonsense steps cannot substitute for congressional action on gun violence," Jackson Lee said. "Congress must come together to build on the president's steps to curb gun violence." \u000a

VCNN's Anderson Cooper will moderate "Guns in America," a town hall featuring President Barack Obama on Thursday at 8 p.m. ET. \u000aWashington (CNN) The nation's largest gun rights organization declined Wednesday to send official representatives to a nationally televised town hall with President Barack Obama on gun violence -- just days after the president reignited a discussion over this controversial topic. \u000a"The National Rifle Association sees no reason to participate in a public relations spectacle organized by the White House," NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told CNN, which is moderating the live town hall Thursday evening in Virginia. \u000aThe NRA, the most influential gun rights group in terms of political persuasion and financial contributions, boasts a membership of about five million people. \u000aA CNN spokesperson said that it was the network, not the White House, that proposed the idea of a town hall on guns, and noted the audience would be evenly divided between organizations that support the Second Amendment including NRA members as well as groups that back gun regulation. \u000aObama on Tuesday presented a renewed push for further gun regulations, including background checks for firearms purchases through the use of executive action. While pro-gun regulation activists heralded Obama's renewed interest in the issue, his actions have been called into question about whether they would truly help stem gun violence. \u000aOn the overall issue of gun control, 48% of Americans support stricter laws, while 51% were opposed, according a CNN/ORC poll released last month. \u000aThe NRA and Obama have been bitter enemies on the issue of new gun regulations -- each accusing the other of engaging in politics instead of working to find solutions to end gun violence. \u000aSome of the groups invited to attend the town hall, which will feature direct audience questioning of the president, include Gun Owners of America, American Firearms Retailers Association, Everytown for Gun Safety and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, among others. \u000aSign up for CNN Politics' Nightcap newsletter, serving up today's best and tomorrow's essentials in politics. \u000a

VWashington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan ripped President Barack Obama on Wednesday, saying he should be more focused on combating terrorism than issuing new executive actions to address gun sales. \u000a"I think it would be nice if he would actually focus on defeating ISIS, on calling radical Islamic terrorism what it is, instead of talking about how we can intimidate and frustrate the Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens," Ryan said at a press conference on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. \u000aRead: Paul Ryan's 2016 plans start with Obamacare repeal vote \u000aRyan didn't rule out suing the administration to block its executive actions to expand background checks for private guns sales, saying, "we will look at all of our options but we will not take this distraction for more than it is -- a distraction." He argued that the problem that the administration says it is addressing -- sales of guns to those who don't get vetted by private dealers -- doesn't exist, saying "there isn't a loophole." \u000aAfter the President announced his plans on Tuesday , many Republicans insisted the move wouldn't survive a legal challenge, and some GOP candidates running for president vowed to undo the order if elected in 2016. \u000a

VThe founder of America\u2019s largest peer-to-peer firearm sales website \u2013 known as the \u201cCraigslist for guns\u201d \u2013 has said that Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions on gun control are \u201cwell-meaning but ultimately ineffective\u201d. \u000aJonathan Gibbon, the founder of Armslist.com , said in a statement to the Guardian that \u201cmany, if not most, private sellers want to do background checks\u201d, but that the current system forces them to physically go to a licensed dealer and pay a fee to do the check. Gibbon said that he wanted to make Nics (the criminal record database) information more available to private citizens in order to \u201cshed light on those who seek to operate under the cover of darkness\u201d. \u000a\u201cFurther scrutiny of law-abiding people will not stop criminals,\u201d he added. \u000aArmslist was founded in 2007 by Gibbon and Brian Mancini, both US air force veterans, after Craigslist banned all posts related to guns. \u000aThe site currently lists more than 60,000 firearms, gun paraphernalia, scopes, silencers and boxes of ammunition for sale, ranging from military-spec assault rifles to antique muzzle-loaded black-powder guns. \u000aPart of Obama\u2019s executive order , phrased as a clarification, states that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter where you conduct your business \u2013 from a store, at gun shows, or over the internet: if you\u2019re in the business of selling firearms, you must get a license and conduct background checks\u201d. \u000aIt goes on to say that \u201cthere is no specific threshold number of firearms purchased or sold that triggers the licensure requirement\u201d, and that \u201ccourts have upheld convictions for dealing without a license when as few as two firearms were sold or when only one or two transactions took place, when other factors also were present\u201d. \u000aFor vendors on Armslist, however, this admittedly indistinct clarification appears to have made little immediate impact. \u000aFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u000aOne vendor, Jim, who declined to give his last name but said that he was the manager of a licensed firearm dealer in St Louis, Missouri, said that the background checks system currently in place, whereby private sellers can choose to involve a licensed dealer as a third party for a fee, already protected sellers from legal liability. \u000a\u201cIf he sells a gun to a felon and something happens, the guy that sold it is gonna be in trouble,\u201d he told the Guardian. But there is currently no requirement for all private sales to go through a licensed dealer. \u000a\u201cIf I was selling it to my uncle, I\u2019d be OK with not doing a transfer,\u201d Jim said. \u201cBut if I\u2019m selling to somebody I don\u2019t know [I\u2019m not sure if I would be OK with that].\u201d \u000aResponses from other vendors varied. One vendor, asked if he required a background check to sell his Sig Sauer assault rifle in his state of Kansas, replied simply: \u201cSure don\u2019t.\u201d Asked if he would personally ask for a background check, he replied: \u201cNope.\u201d \u000aBut most claimed that they would require the firearms they had for sale to be transferred via a dealer who had a Federal Firearm License (FFL), and therefore a background check. \u000aOne vendor, who was selling an AR-15 assault rifle, told the Guardian that in his home state of Oregon the issue was null, because the state already requires a background check for all firearms sold. Eighteen states, including Oregon, have enacted varying levels of mandatory background checks. \u000aPatrick, a user who posted an advertisement seeking a .45 caliber Beretta Storm rifle, said that he would prefer to buy from someone within his state \u2013 Kansas \u2013 in order to avoid the rigmarole associated with moving weapons across state lines. \u000aHe would not have to take a background check if he found a private seller who would sell to him from within Kansas, Patrick (who requested that his last name be withheld) told the Guardian. \u000aHe said that personally he was \u201cin the middle\u201d on the issue of universal background checks. Organisations that pose as private sellers, like those that set up booths at gun sales and sell in bulk, ought to be forced to do them because they are operating as commercial firearm sellers, he added. \u000aBut he balked at forcing individuals to go through the process of checking the backgrounds of those they choose to sell their weaponry to, preferring a \u201cbill of sale\u201d \u2013 essentially, an honor system. \u000a\u201cIn good faith, I would have to ask the buyer to disclose that he or she is not legally prohibited from owning or buying a firearm, that they are of legal age \u2013 which I could verify through observation \u2013 that they\u2019re not violating any state local or federal laws, that they haven\u2019t been convicted in any court of a crime, that they\u2019re not a fugitive,\u201d he said. \u000aAnother user, who was selling an AK-47 rifle, said he did not personally require background checks at this point. \u201cAs long as Obama doesn\u2019t get his way!\u201d he added. \u000a

VPresident Barack Obama detailed his plan to work around lawmakers to implement tougher gun control measures, but the Republican-held Congress holds the keys for funding the administration\u2019s changes. \u000aRep. John Culberson, R-Texas, chairman of the appropriations subcommittee in charge of financing the Justice Department, threatened to defund the agency should the White House move forward with its unilateral gun actions described Tuesday by Obama. \u000a\u201cI will not sit by and permit our Second Amendment rights to be diminished or damaged in any way when I have the duty as chairman of this subcommittee to ensure that our hard-earned tax dollars are spent in strict accordance with the Constitution and federal law, period,\u201d Culberson told The Daily Signal. \u000aHe pledged to use every tool at his disposal to ensure the Justice Department acts within its boundaries and does not overstep existing federal law. \u000aCulberson sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Monday vowing to withhold taxpayer dollars from the Justice Department if the administration implements \u201cunlawful limitations\u201d on the Second Amendment. \u000aWhile none of his colleagues has publicly backed the plan, Culberson said he was confident he could convince GOP members to sign on after the House Republican whip team reconvened Tuesday night. \u000a\u201cThis administration has overreached more often than any other administration in my memory and the only tool that seems to deter them is the power of the purse,\u201d he said. \u000aA teary-eyed Obama detailed a string of executive actions intended to curb gun violence in the president\u2019s first gun control push of the New Year. \u000aOne key proposal mandates more firearms dealers to obtain a federal license, requiring those sellers to conduct background checks on customers purchasing weapons. The change is aimed at dealers currently exempt from federal licensing rules, including those who sell at gun shows or online. \u000aThe president also directed the FBI to hire more than 230 additional personnel to process background checks and he said he will request funding from Congress to add 200 agents to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for tougher enforcement of gun laws. \u000aObama also will seek $500 million for mental health treatment and said the administration will strengthen requirements for reporting lost and stolen guns. \u000a\u201cThe gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage right now, but they cannot hold America hostage,\u201d Obama said , noting roughly 30,000 people die by gunfire each year. \u000a\u201cWe do not have to accept this carnage as the price of freedom,\u201d he said, to a standing ovation at the White House event. \u000aAlthough the president\u2019s proposals would skirt the typical legislative process, his plans largely depend on congressional budget approval. \u000aMembers of the House Appropriations Committee demanded that Lynch enforce federal guns laws already in place rather than \u201ccreate new law\u201d through executive actions. \u000aRep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., called Obama\u2019s new proposals a \u201ccheap stunt by a lawless president,\u201d citing a Washington Post piece that conceded new gun laws would not have prevented the mass shootings last year. \u000a\u201cWe must use every tool at our disposal, including the power of the purse and, if necessary, the pursuit of legal action, to put a check on this unconstitutional overreach,\u201d Black said in a statement Tuesday. \u000aCongressional Democrats overwhelmingly backed the administration\u2019s gun control plan, rallying against their Republican counterparts for planning to block the president\u2019s actions. \u000a\u201cI\u2019m sure that my Republican colleagues in the House and the Senate will try to block his executive action. They will not succeed,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told MSNBC on Monday. \u201cThey won\u2019t get the votes in the Senate, and even if they did the president would veto it.\u201d \u000aObama was to continue his appeal to Americans for tougher gun measures during a \u201ctown hall\u201d Thursday night hosted by CNN at George Mason University. \u000a

VFlanked by families who lost loved ones to mass shootings, President Barack Obama fought back tears as he announced a unilateral push to curb crimes committed with guns and called for a renewed national \u201csense of urgency\u201d on the issue. \u000aAt his press conference Tuesday, Obama outlined immediate executive actions to expand existing background checks, close loopholes, and increase mental health funding\u2013all without going to Congress for legislation. \u000aBut at the same time, Obama admitted more significant gun control \u201cwon\u2019t happen in my presidency.\u201d He underscored what he called the need for future congressional action and said Republican lawmakers were being \u201cheld hostage by the gun lobby.\u201d \u000aThe Daily Signal reviewed four of the president\u2019s key points against available data: \u000aClaim: \u201cWe are the only advanced country on Earth that sees this kind of mass violence erupt with this kind of frequency. It doesn\u2019t happen in other advanced countries. It\u2019s not even close.\u201d \u000aObama adjusted an often-made, often-questioned argument that America is the only modern nation to suffer from epidemic gun violence. His current talking point is a combination of two discredited claims. \u000aSpeaking of the San Bernardino massacre, just weeks after the Nov. 13 terror attacks that left 130 dead in Paris, Obama still said \u201cmass shootings just [don\u2019t] happen in other countries.\u201d That claim earned him four Pinocchios as a \u201cwhopper\u201d of a falsehood from The Washington Post \u2019s \u201cFact Checker\u201d column. \u000aBackpedaling, the White House later said the president meant to address the frequency of shootings in the U.S. compared to other nations. Again, \u201cFact Checker\u201d columnist Glenn Kessler criticized this as a likely \u201capples-to-oranges comparison\u201d and gave the president two Pinocchios for \u201csignificant omissions and/or exaggerations.\u201d \u000aClaim: \u201c The problem is, some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules. A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked.\u201d \u000aThat\u2019s not exactly factual, according to an August 2013 report by The Washington Post. Purchasing a gun online from a federal firearms license holder or a vendor across state lines does require a background check. \u000aTo avoid a background check, a buyer would have to meet with the seller in person to purchase the firearm. As the Post notes, \u201cthat would be a private sale and federal law wouldn\u2019t require a background check.\u201d \u000aSeveral states already require their own background checks for firearms sales\u2014some for all guns, others only for handguns. Additionally, it\u2019s a felony to sell guns knowingly to someone with a criminal record or history of mental health problems. \u000aMost criminals do their illegal gun shopping on the streets, not online, research shows. \u000aA study last year by the University of Chicago Crime Lab found that most criminals said they don\u2019t get their weapons from gun shows or order them online, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Instead, they buy the guns from those close to them or other criminals. \u000aIn a survey of about 100 prisoners, the lab found, 70 percent said they received guns from friends, family, and fellow gang members. \u000aClaim: \u201cIf there\u2019s an app that can help us find a missing tablet,\u201d Obama said, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t do it with a stolen gun.\u201d Just as a child \u201ccan\u2019t open a bottle of aspirin,\u201d he added, a child shouldn\u2019t be able to \u201cpull a trigger on a gun.\u201d \u000aTechnology to make firearms more like iPads and Tylenol bottles isn\u2019t commercially available. None of the so-called smart guns\u2014which require entry of a fingerprint or other biometric signal before firing\u2014is on the market. \u000aThe earliest and leading version of the smart gun, the Armatix iP1, has been found wanting. In an exclusive performance review by a subsidiary of the National Rifle Association dismissed the weapon as \u201cdisappointing at best, and alarming at worst.\u201d \u000aAlthough the NRA\u2019s assessment is biased, the economic component speaks for itself. The current price tag for the Armatix iP1: $1,798. \u000aSmart gun technology would do little to affect civilian guns in circulation across the country. A 2012 Congressional Research Service report concluded 310 million guns were in private hands in America in 2009. \u000aDuring the Obama administration, however, demand for and manufacturing of firearms has only increased. \u000aClaim: \u201cAnd the constant excuses for inaction no longer do, no longer suffice. That\u2019s why we are here today. Not to debate the last mass shooting, but to do something to prevent the next one.\u201d \u000aTo make the case for stricter gun controls and increased background checks, the president enumerated every mass shooting from 2009 at Fort Hood, Texas, to last month in San Bernardino, Calif. \u000aThrough executive action, Obama said the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol. Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives would hire more than 200 employees to ensure \u201ceffective enforcement of gun safety laws that are already on the books.\u201d \u000aAccording to a Washington Times report , however, existing gun laws failed in most of the cases listed by Obama. \u000aIn each attack, background checks either were easily flouted or found entirely ineffective. \u000aAnd none of the attackers, the Times reported, purchased his gun or guns through \u201cthe so-called gun-show loophole\u201d that the president said he seeks to close. \u000a

VNorth Carolina\u2019s delegate on the House of Representatives task force responsible for guiding much of the proposed policy for increased gun control said this week that President Barack Obama was left with little choice than to pursue executive action to achieve what he calls \u201ccommon-sense\u201d gun safety and violence reduction measures. \u000aU.S. Rep. David Price, D-N.C., said Tuesday it\u2019s Congress\u2019 fault for not acting sooner to expand background checks for more people buying a gun, and he accused many of his Republican congressional colleagues of being \u201cin the pocket\u201d of the National Rifle Association. \u000aMeanwhile, Republicans from North Carolina criticized Obama\u2019s action this week, calling it a \u201cgun grab\u201d and an attack on the Second Amendment right to bear arms. \u000aData from the Center for Responsive Politics , a nonpartisan group that tracks the influence of money on policy and politicians, shows the NRA spent nearly $28 million lobbying in 2014 \u2013 the most recent year for which complete information is available. The data shows the NRA spent more money than any other gun-rights group on lobbying and nearly $14.3 million more than all gun-control groups combined in 2014. \u000aPrice sits on the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, a Democratic group formed after 26 people, including 20 children, were gunned down in December 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The group put forth detailed policy proposals in February 2013, but Congress hasn\u2019t passed any substantial gun control laws since then. \u000aIn the past 10 years, Price has received $750 to his campaign from gun control activist groups. This election cycle, so far, he\u2019s reported no money from gun control lobbyists, according to OpenSecrets.org, the website for the Center for Responsive Politics. \u000aOne of three Democrats serving in Congress from North Carolina, Price has backed every universal background check and assault weapons ban bill that\u2019s come up for debate in recent years. And, every time, he and fellow Democrats have found themselves on the losing side. \u000aPrice says not all of his Republican colleagues in the House \u2013 but most of them and specifically GOP party leaders \u2013 are to blame for blocking any gun control legislation since Obama\u2019s been in office. GOP lawmakers, Price said, are afraid of being attacked or disowned by the NRA. \u000aA few Democratic gun control policy ideas, such as universal background checks, are generally supported by a majority of Americans, according to recent popular opinion polls. But, Price said, those bills can\u2019t pass in a Republican-controlled Congress. \u000aFor Democrats, a top question, Price said, is \u201chow do we cut through the hammerlock that the NRA has on Congress?\u201d \u000aFor Republicans, including most of North Carolina\u2019s congressional delegation, a top question is how to reverse or stymie Obama\u2019s executive actions. \u000aSen. Richard Burr called the executive actions a \u201cgun grab.\u201d Sen. Thom Tillis characterized Obama\u2019s move as \u201coverstepping\u201d presidential authority and attempting to create laws \u201cunilaterally.\u201d \u000aOther North Carolina Republican lawmakers chimed in on social media sites and by sending out news statements. \u000aRep. Mark Meadows lobbed criticism at Obama\u2019s \u201cexecutive fiat,\u201d saying the president\u2019s efforts bypass the legislative branch and subvert Congress\u2019 will. \u000aRep. Walter Jones called the president\u2019s actions \u201cblatant disregard for the Second Amendment,\u201d and he decried Obama\u2019s proposed spending and federal resource additions as measures that \u201cwill only expand the size of government.\u201d \u000aRep. Renee Ellmers reminded constituents she\u2019s a North Carolina concealed carry permit holder and pledged to not let Obama \u201ctrample on our constitutional right to bear arms.\u201d \u000aRep. Robert Pittenger criticized Obama for not meeting with Congress to write bipartisan legislation and added that medical privacy laws should change to increase access to mental health information. \u000aEDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE \u000aStill, Price argues Obama already has tried to work with Congress. \u000a\u201cIt is not his preference to act alone. . . . The president has done what he needs to do,\u201d Price said. \u000aWhile critics point out that changes in background checks and enforcement wouldn\u2019t have prevented most of the recent mass shootings, Price contends Obama\u2019s work will \u201csave lives.\u201d Though, he acknowledged, \u201cthese are not huge changes.\u201d \u000aDemocratic Rep. G.K. Butterfield attended Obama\u2019s address from the White House East Room on Tuesday morning. \u000a

VOn any given day, there are tens of thousands of guns listed for sale on the Internet. President Obama announced this week that he's expanding criminal background checks into the vibrant online market. \u000aThe president's supporters say his executive action will help close a major loophole in existing gun laws. But gun rights advocates called Obama's move an overreach, and questioned whether it would help prevent shootings. \u000aIf you want to buy a gun online, it already takes a lot more than a single click. When licensed gun dealers sell online, they're required to perform background checks. And they have to ship to another licensed dealer. But sales between individuals are treated differently. In more than 30 states, private sellers are not required to run background checks. \u000a"You have to go meet them like you buy a dresser on Craigslist, and exchange the money," says Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, a vice president at Third Way, a Washington, D.C. think tank, which studied the online gun market Armslist.com during the summer of 2013. Think Craigslist, but for guns. Hatalsky says there are licensed gun dealers on the site. But they're far outnumbered by private sellers. \u000a"There are people who are selling 20 guns at one particular moment in a state," Hatalsky says, "or people selling who were selling five guns, and then the next day would list more. There were are lot of folks who were clearly using this as a source of income, and a way to connect frequently with people they wanted to sell guns to." \u000aThe president's executive action aims to force those people to register as gun dealers by clarifying the existing federal law about who exactly is "engaged in the business" of selling firearms. \u000a"It doesn't matter whether you're doing it over the Internet, or at a gun show," Obama said Tuesday. "It's not where you do it, but what you do." \u000aThe president's order may have limited impact in states that already require background checks for nearly all gun sales. That's the case in New York. But Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance says the White House's actions could help curb the flow of illegal guns into states like his. \u000a"In New York state, for example, they are not going to have direct impact in any big sense," says Vance, who also co-chairs the group Prosecutors Against Gun Violence. "But the lax gun control and background checks from other states enables people to buy guns and then bring them to New York. Nine out of 10 guns that are involved in crimes of violence in New York come from out of state." \u000aStill, gun rights advocates question whether expanded background checks would stop criminals from getting guns. Kim Stolfer, president of the group Firearms Owners Against Crime in western Pennsylvania, says the president's order is more likely to hurt law-abiding gun owners. \u000a"The average person that commits an unintentional violation, who decides to buy a gun, or to sell a firearm," Stolfer says, "and somebody says to him, 'Oh yeah, man, you can sell it online.' He goes over and he does it. And it's a sting operation." \u000aIn a statement , Jonathan Gibbon, the co-founder of Armslist.com, called the president's action "well-meaning but ultimately ineffective." But at least one of the site's users says he's OK with more background checks. \u000a"I think it's crazy that a criminal can reply to an ad on Armslist and say, 'Hey, I'm interested in your gun.' And they can walk away with a gun," says Kyle Ecklund of Ohio. The 26-year-old school teacher says he's bought and sold several guns on the site \u2014 always legally, to another Ohio resident, face to face. But without a background check. \u000a"I think there should be a background check on every firearm transfer," Ecklund told NPR. "And I'm willing to compromise with people who want more gun control. I'm willing to compromise with them and say, 'OK, I agree that we should have that.' " \u000aThe question is whether Washington is willing to make the same compromise. \u000a

The Obama administration is making changes in that realm by seeking to plug certain Social Security Administration data into the background check system and by helping states report more information about people barred from gun possession for mental health reasons.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The suspect in a shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, should have been flagged at the time, but errors and delays cleared the way for his purchase.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<strong>See President Obama addressing the nation after mass shootings throughout his tenure:</strong><br />\u000a<!-- %Slideshow-353321% --></p>\u000a\u000a<p>Though the moves probably wouldn't have prevented recent mass shootings, Obama rejected the idea that undermines the changes.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>"We maybe can't save everybody, but we could save some," Obama said.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>A look at how some recent mass shooting suspects got their weapons:</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Dec. 2, 2015, San Bernardino, California, 14 killed</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Syed Farook and his wife used weapons that the FBI says his neighbor, Enrique Marquez, purchased legally from a federally licensed dealer in 2011 and 2012. Marquez, now facing conspiracy and other charges, told investigators that Farook asked him to purchase the weapons because he would draw less attention. At the time, the FBI says, the men were plotting to shoot up a community college and a highway.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>___</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Oct. 1, 2015, Roseburg, Oregon, 10 killed</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Christopher Harper-Mercer and his family members legally purchased the handguns and rifle he used in the Umpqua Community College shooting from a federally licensed gun dealer, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>___</p>\u000a\u000a<p>July 16, 2015, Chattanooga, Tennessee, 5 killed</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The FBI says some of the weapons Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez used in his attack on a pair of military facilities were purchased legally and some were not. It is unclear when the purchases were made and whether he was subject to a background check. Relatives say Abdulazeez had a history of mental illness, made a series of overseas trips and was arrested in April on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. In May 2013, he failed a background check for an engineering job at a nuclear power plant in Ohio.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>___</p>\u000a\u000a<p>June 17, 2015, Charleston, South Carolina, 9 killed</p>\u000a\u000a<p>A February drug arrest should have prevented Dylann Roof from purchasing the pistol authorities say he used at Emanuel AME Church, but a record-keeping error and background check delay allowed the transaction to go through.

After three days passed, the gun dealer was legally permitted to complete the transaction.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>___</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Sept. 16, 2013, Washington, D.C., 12 killed</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Aaron Alexis, a former reservist turned civilian contractor, passed state and federal background checks and legally purchased the pump-action shotgun used in the Washington Navy Yard shooting despite a history of violent outbursts and recent mental health treatment. Alexis was accused of firing a gun in anger in Texas in 2004 and Seattle in 2010, but was not prosecuted in either case. In 2011, he received an honorable discharge despite bouts of insubordination, disorderly conduct and unauthorized absences. None of that would have disqualified him from purchasing a weapon.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>___</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Dec. 14, 2012, Newtown, Connecticut, 26 killed</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Adam Lanza used his mother's weapons, including a .223-caliber semi-automatic rifle, in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

VOn Tuesday, President Barack Obama outlined a series of steps intended to reduce gun violence in America. In the three years since Sandy Hook, Congress has repeatedly deadlocked on the issue. Obama\u2019s proposed changes fall far short of what was proposed in the legislature, and is generally limited to clarifying and enforcing existing law \u2014 with one exception. \u000aFirst, let\u2019s overview the changes. Obama intends to close the background check loophole that allows online sales and gun show sales to proceed without requiring a background check, as well as to overhaul the background check system used by the FBI. The current system has proven woefully inadequate at preventing shooters with documented mental health problems from buying firearms; The New York Times reports that the shooters in eight of the past 15 mass shootings had documented mental health issues that did not appear on background checks. \u000aImproving and overhauling background checks takes additional manpower. As part of this initiative, Obama wants to hire an additional 200 agents for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. He also called for a reduction in the barriers that keep important information about mental health isolated between states, and promised an additional $500 million in federal funding for treatment of mental health issues. \u000aFinally \u2014 and this is new \u2014 Obama ordered the DOD, DOJ, and Homeland Security \u201cto conduct or sponsor research into gun safety technology\u201d that would cut down on the number of negligent, accidental, and unauthorized discharges of firearms in the United States. \u000aCan better tech create safer weapons? \u000aLet\u2019s take a closer look at this last point. A so-called \u201csmart gun\u201d is a firearm that includes an authentication system that only fires when its owner (or another, authorized user) allows it to do so. The concept dates back decades \u2014 one system, Magna Lock, first came to market in 1975 and is still sold today. Magna Lock only works with a handful of revolvers, but places a magnet inside the weapon that prevents it from being fired unless the operator is wearing a matching ring. Most publications cite it as the only \u201csmart\u201d technology that ever shipped. \u000aIn theory, the field should be wide open for better, more flexible alternatives. There are a number of easy, low-range networking options that can be used to link a firearm to an authentication token, fingerprint scanners are cheap, and RFID is an established technology. A quick survey of the market shows a number of devices are in development, including projects that rely on all these methods. Some companies are even working on systems that could be retrofitted to existing hardware, thereby addressing the concerns of gun owners who might genuinely prefer such options but don\u2019t want to buy expensive new firearms. \u000aWhat\u2019s less clear is whether or not these systems can be made sufficiently flexible and affordable to interest gun owners. None of the \u201csmart\u201d weapons we\u2019ve seen in-market to-date have been inexpensive \u2014 certainly not as inexpensive as a gun safe and reliable lock. Unless the government wants to wait decades for smart gun technology to make a difference in accidental shooting rates, owners need kits that can be easily retrofitted to existing devices without compromising their functionality \u2014 and these kits need to be extremely secure, while remaining easy to configure. Any designer of a smart gun kit has to allow for the fact that some users will rely on the fact that the weapon is supposedly secure, and will therefore be more prone to leaving a firearm lying about than they might be otherwise. \u000aThe Armatix iP1 \u000aTo date, the handful of solutions on the market, like the Armatix iP1 , have not reviewed particularly well, although the only significant review appears to have been written by a publication of the NRA, which opposes smart guns on principle. It\u2019s true that the United States government, as the largest purchaser of firearms in the US, could spur new innovation and research on safety technologies. But firearms are generally valued because they offer simple, straightforward operation. \u000aThe DOJ, DOD, and FBI have been ordered to submit reports by April that detail the real-world deployment of smart gun technologies, according to the Army Times, and presumably include recommendations on which of the various authentication technologies to back. This will be a long-term project if anything comes of it. But we\u2019ll be curious to see if the concerted backing of the US government can spur gun manufacturers to field results more practical than what we\u2019ve seen to-date. \u000a

VDelaware gun laws already require gun buyers to get a background check regardless of where in the state they purchase a weapon. \u000aSo while President Barack Obama's proposal won't impact how people purchase guns here, it might help stem the number of arms flowing into Delaware from nearby states with weak gun laws, according to gun-control advocates. More than half of the guns recovered in Delaware by law enforcement during a five-year period came from other states, according to a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' report. \u000a"By subjecting more gun sellers to federal regulations, it means that more background checks will be conducted in states that do not have private sale background checks like Delaware," said Allison Anderman, a staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which lobbies for comprehensive gun-control measures. "And therefore there should be fewer guns being trafficked and entering the criminal marketplace." \u000aSixty-one percent of guns recovered in Delaware by law enforcement from 2010 to 2014 \u2013 the most recent years available \u2013 came from other states, according to five years of studies by the ATF. Delaware's top three source states in 2014 were Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia, respectively. \u000aOf those three states, only Maryland received a higher grade than Delaware from Anderman's group in its annual Gun Law State Scorecard. Maryland scored an A-, while Delaware had a B. Pennsylvania had a C, and Virginia received a D. \u000aGun advocates, however, say Obama's gun plan impinges on their rights and doesn't address criminals' ability to get their hands on guns illegally. \u000a"The more laws you put on something, it increases the black market for it," said Tyler Yzaguirre founder and former president of the University of Delaware's Students for the Second Amendment Club. Yzaguirre, who graduated last month from UD, said the laws make only law-abiding citizens cut through red tape. \u000a"Criminals get it without having to do any of that," he said. "Why should criminals have the advantage?" \u000aWhile in support of legislation that reduces gun violence, New Castle County Police Chief Elmer Setting said "straw purchases," in which a third-party person is paid to buy a gun, and drug-driven burglaries are problems that officers are seeing too often. \u000a"Do I support the legislation? Yes, completely," Setting said. "But I see the reality of it, which is John Smith, who is in Gang A, is not walking into Miller's Gun Center and buying a gun. He knows there's a background check. \u000a"So what he's doing is trading heroin for a gun or he's getting his girlfriend to buy him a gun." \u000aSetting said more has to be done to hold people who purchase weapons accountable for the crimes committed with the gun. \u000aWilmington Police Chief Bobby Cummings agreed on needing to do more to prevent young people from getting guns through straw purchases. \u000a"Whatever we can do on the front end to stop those guns from reaching them would be good," he said. "Because we don't think background checks and stuff like that for them. That's not the issue. \u000a"It's the people who are getting them on the front end that we need to [look at]. If we can slow that process down, it would be impactful for us." \u000aObama broke into tears on Tuesday when announcing a series of executive actions on guns. He spoke to an audience of families of gun violence victims, gun owners and gun-control advocates. \u000aHis gun plan would attempt to clarify that people selling guns at gun shops, gun shows and on the Internet will be required to conduct background checks if they are in the business of selling firearms. It also plans for the FBI to hire more than 230 additional examiners and other staff to help process these background checks 24 hours, 7 days a week. \u000aPeople should not underestimate the impact of increasing the number of people conducting background checks, Anderman said. \u000a"One of the reasons that we have such high levels of gun violence in the United States is because of our patchwork system of state laws and our lack of meaningful federal regulation," she said. \u000aGov. Jack Markell, who in 2013 signed the law closing the state's "private sale" loophole that required background checks for sales and transfers of firearms between private parties, including Internet sales, said he supports the Obama administration's efforts to highlight the importance of receiving complete criminal history records, information on people disqualified because of a mental illness and qualifying crimes of domestic violence. \u000a"We are in receipt of the letter from Attorney General Loretta Lynch requesting state support of initiatives to improve the quality and quantity of information that states report into [the National Instant Criminal Background Check System] and look forward to further dialogue with the FBI and the Obama administration on those issues," said Jonathon Dworkin, a Markell spokesman. \u000aMarkell's office also is in support of strengthening ATF's budget and personnel. \u000a"Our work with ATF in the Violence Reduction Network has been helpful, and we welcome additional ATF resources," Dworkin said. "We realize that state initiatives alone will not address gun violence and trafficking in Delaware and believe federal partnership is a critical law enforcement tool." \u000aStaff reporter Jenna Pizzi contributed to this story. \u000aContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299, eparra@delawareonline.com or Twitter @eparra3. \u000a

VPresident Barack Obama\u2019s proposed executive actions on gun violence were met with mixed reactions from Illinois politicians on Tuesday. Unsurprisingly, opposition and support for the measures fell along party lines. \u000aFollowing Obama\u2019s address to the nation, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., held a press conference with Ald. Willie Cochran (20th) in Englewood, one of Chicago\u2019s most crime-ridden neighborhoods, during which they praised the president\u2019s steps to strengthen and enforce gun laws. \u000aDurbin pointed out that Chicago led the U.S. in gun deaths with 468 in 2015, and that the number of shooting victims increased 13 percent over the year to a record 2,939. \u000a\u201cGo to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as I did just a few months ago. Ask them the following question: When you go to the most violent sections of the city of Chicago \u2014 where the most gun incidents and crimes are taking place and you gather the crime guns and check out where they came from \u2014 what do you find? Forty percent of the crime guns in the deadliest sections of Chicago come from gun shows in northwestern Indiana,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cWhy? There\u2019s no background check. They sell these guns in volumes and they sell ammunition. These gangsters fill up the trunks of their car, drive across the state line into the city of Chicago and you know what happens next. They are sold to anyone who can put the money up for the purchase and then they turn into deadly weapons.\u201d \u000aRepublican U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk on Sunday, before Obama unveiled his plan, seemed to avoid the partisan divide, saying in a tweet, \u201cThis year I supported keeping guns from suspected terrorists & called on POTUS to look at social media in background checks.\u201d \u000aHere\u2019s a list of statements from other Illinois politicians -- mostly congressmen who represent the suburbs and Chicago -- on Obama\u2019s gun control plans. See what your U.S. representative had to say. \u000a

VHaving been stymied by Congress in previous attempts to tighten gun laws, Obama Tuesday unveiled a set of actions that would modestly broaden the definition of who qualifies as a gun dealer, streamline reporting of mental health issues for purposes of background checks, require better tracking of lost or stolen firearms and bolster enforcement of existing laws. \u000a"The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage right now, but they can't hold America hostage," Obama said at the White House, standing with a group of people who were victims of shootings or lost loved ones to gun violence. "Congress still needs to act. The folks in this room will not rest until they do." \u000aThe initiative falls short of the broad changes in gun laws that Obama has called for in the past. But it drew criticism even before it was previewed by White House officials Monday night and may face challenges in court. \u000aHouse Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans denounced the move as executive overreach, with the Wisconsin Republican saying the effort "will no doubt be challenged in the courts." \u000a"His words and actions amount to a form of intimidation that undermines liberty," Ryan said in a statement, adding that Obama "has never respected the right to safe and legal gun ownership." \u000aObama's measures include tougher rules for those who currently sell firearms at gun shows and on the Internet without submitting buyers' names for criminal background checks, and a warning to sellers that they face criminal prosecution if they try to skirt the law. \u000aThe administration proposes hiring hundreds of new workers to modernize the background check system and to handle the additional requests for checks. In addition, Obama is requesting $500 million for new mental health research and the Department of Health and Human Services is clarifying rules to remove some of the barriers to reporting a person's mental health status to the background check information system. \u000aObama invoked the list of mass shootings that have taken place while he's been in office. He wiped tears from his eyes as he recalled the shootings of 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. \u000a"Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad," he said. \u000aPotentially the most contentious piece of Obama's executive actions is broadening the definition of a gun dealer. The plan targets small-scale gun sellers, who may conduct transactions from home, a gun show or via the Internet and aren't required to hold a license or submit buyers' names for federal background screening. \u000aObama said requiring criminal background checks of buyers at at gun stores isn't an infringement on the Second Amendment right to bear arms, and expanding those checks "is not a plot to take away everyone's guns." \u000aHowever, the expanded background checks wouldn't have blocked the sales of weapons used in most recent mass shootings, including the December terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, and the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook. The firearms in those cases were purchased legally through conventional outlets. \u000aGun rights organizations gave the president's actions a mixed response, saying they wanted to see how the government implemented the new executive actions. \u000aThe National Shooting Sports Foundation said that it supported the administration's effort to beef up staffing for the FBI's background check system, and agreed that the government should do more to get mental health records shared with the federal government. \u000aBut the administration's new criteria for who must register as a licensed gun dealer "needs considerable clarification," the group said in a statement. And the administration's requirement that manufacturers report weapons lost in shipping are "misdirected" because the recipients of the weapons are in better position to know if guns arrived, the group said. \u000aGun control advocates argue that any constraints on access to weapons will reverberate throughout the murky gun market that has been booming as the threat of new restrictions has made news. According to the FBI, the agency's National Instant Background Check System processed 23.1 million firearm background checks in 2015. That was 2.2 million more than the previous year, and an all-time record for the agency. \u000aWhite House officials said the executive actions would have a tangible impact. Press secretary Josh Earnest said that over the past 15 years, an average of 1,300 guns reported as lost or stolen had been recovered annually at crime scenes. The steps to tighten reporting could help reduce that number. And, the White House said, additional mental health screenings could help prevent suicides that represent two-thirds of the nation's 30,000 annual gun deaths. \u000aMark Niquette, Andrew Harris and Toluse Olorunnipa contributed. \u000a

VThe importance of optics is something that has been discussed in this space before, particularly as it pertains to President Obama. \u000aOn a few occasions throughout his seven years in office, he has tripped badly in this regard, even admitting regret after one instance ( golfing minutes after announcing the beheading of American journalist James Foley by ISIS) and acknowledging that the theater of the job does matter. Which brings us to Tuesday\u2019s announcement from the White House East Room regarding Mr. Obama\u2019s executive action on a string of new gun control measures. Simple question: Was the message and presentation effective? \u000aFirst, a quick review: President makes announcement. Evokes Sandy Hook massacre. Begins to cry. Says he thinks about it every day and it makes him angry. This is a departure from the president\u2019s lack of emotion following other horrific events recently (Paris, San Bernardino) and therefore notable. Context: When John Boehner cried, it lost it\u2019s noteworthiness after the 2nd or 3rd time. But Obama\u2019s emotion appears genuine here, heartfelt. If you\u2019re a father like me and millions more out there, you drop your kids off at an educational facility every morning and marvel at the innocence and happiness of it all. And to think a monster could go in there and start executing them is enough to make any parent break down, particularly when relatives of victims of gun violence are surrounding you as they were with the president yesterday. Note: Roughly 47 percent of you out there will automatically say the president was putting on a show; another 47 percent happen will believe the emotion was sincere. That\u2019s just the way it is today\u2026 \u000aBottom line regarding optics here: The president\u2019s speech was very effective in that he showed he cares \u2026 that he\u2019s trying to at least do something about a growing, disturbing problem facing this country to any extent he can on his own. \u000aOf course, the strategy itself or focus applied may not correct or clear. Here\u2019s what the AP fact check conclusion is on the president\u2019s announcement: \u000aThe gun control measures a tearful President Barack Obama announced Tuesday would not have prevented the slaughters of 20 first-graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, or 14 county workers at a holiday party in San Bernardino, California. \u2026 \u000aThose measures are seen as crucial to stemming gun suicides \u2014 the cause of two-thirds of gun deaths \u2014 by blocking immediate access to weapons. But, an Associated Press review shows, they would have had no impact in keeping weapons from the hands of suspects in several of the deadliest recent mass shootings that have spurred calls for tighter gun control. \u000aThe shooters at Sandy Hook and San Bernardino used weapons bought by others, shielding them from background checks. In other cases, the shooters legally bought guns. \u000aThen there\u2019s enforcement \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 of existing gun laws currently on the books. According to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, gun convictions peaked at 9,206 ten years ago but have steadily declined under the current administration, hitting a low of 6,002 in fiscal year 2015 \u2014 a drop of 35 percent. \u000aBut here\u2019s the thing about the AP fact check and the stats cited around gun convictions above: Only those following the story closely and/or have a certain position on guns are remotely aware of that fact check or of those stats. Instead, the only image and soundbites likely heard by a solid majority of people not glued to the news or Internet all day were those of a tearful president and his efforts to curb gun violence in this country. And with a CBS News/New York Times poll in October showing hat 92 percent of Americans \u2014 including 87 percent of Republicans \u2014 favoring background checks for all gun buyers, almost all will see or hear what the president said and nod in agreement despite any fact-checks or stats presented after the fact. \u000aFinally, here\u2019s another reason why the president won the optics game and the news cycle yesterday: The NRA\u2019s deplorable tweet (gaining more attention in the press) aimed at two New York lawmakers who recently announced legislation seeking to limit ammunition sales. As you can see, the image \u2014 courtesy of an NRA publication called America\u2019s 1st Freedom \u2014 features photos of state Senator Roxanne Persaud (D) and Assemblywoman Jo Anne Simon (D) with bullets sprinkled next to them. Obviously both disturbing and dangerous, and an optic fail of the very worst kind. \u000a\u2014 Americas1stFreedom (@NRAA1F) January 4, 2016 \u000aSo agree with the president\u2019s actions, disagree with it. Either way, the presentation was effective, and the basic message of \u201cat least he\u2019s trying to to something\u201d resonates. And in this political environment, the message sometimes is as important as the substance \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 behind it. \u000a

VPresident Barack Obama was right and within his limited powers in the basic actions he announced Tuesday to reduce gun violence in this country. We have waited year after year for Congress to act, but it would not and could not summon the courage to do so. \u000aIf the slaughter of 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14, 2012, could not give the majority of Congress the will for reform, then we do not know what ever could. Mass shootings keep happening \u2014 including in a church, a community college and a regional health center in just the last year. \u000aAmong the several worthwhile actions that Obama will take, at least three should be indisputable: \u000a\u2014 The licensing of gun dealers and conducting of background checks on the buyers no matter where guns are sold. Those who sell firearms in stores are licensed, and background checks required, so it closes a loophole to extend the license and checks to gun shows and internet sales. No one\u2019s rights are taken away. \u000a\u2014 The hiring of 230 additional FBI staff to process background checks 24/7. Now if a check does not clear within 72 hours, it is automatically approved, which is how the shooter at the Baptist church in Charleston obtained a weapon. Quicker background checks take away no one\u2019s rights. \u000a\u2014 The additional investment of $500 million to increase access to mental health care. A portion of this will go to the states, likely through Medicaid, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy told journalists in a conference call shortly after attending the White House announcement Tuesday. Broader mental health care takes away no one\u2019s rights. \u000aCriticism of the president\u2019s actions was swift, shallow and obligatory. He overstepped executive bounds, they said. Not so; all of the measures are within directing departments, such as Defense, Homeland Security and Justice, under his purview. He infringed on Second Amendment rights, they said. Not so; the measures build on requirements already in place. \u000aIt does no good, for presidential candidates or anyone, to frame the issue as a polarizing Second Amendment rights versus gun control. The long overdue action is about common sense gun safety. \u000aCongress will have to make choices on how to fund these measures, whether by raising taxes or cutting elsewhere, but we have to accommodate what is important for the common good. \u000aConnecticut already has some of the toughest laws in the country, but that cannot and does not stop illegal guns from entering the state \u2014 Malloy Tuesday actually called I-95 a \u201cgun corridor.\u201d All 50 states, instead of just a handful, need stricter laws. \u000aConnecticut, which has been a leader on gun safety legislation, was well represented at the White House press conference Tuesday; besides Malloy several family members of those killed at Sandy Hook, leaders of the grassroots Sandy Hook Promise and Newtown Action Alliance attended. The state\u2019s two senators and Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty , whose district includes Newtown, all strong proponents of action, met the day before with the president. These were fine moments, small victories, for those who have worked passionately since Sandy Hook to affect change. \u000aObama\u2019s new measures are good and necessary, but not enough. The next president would have the power to overturn them. Congress still needs to listen to the majority of the American people, instead of the powerful gun lobbies, and enact lasting legislation to make the country safer. \u000a

VPresident Barack Obama unveiled an array of measures on Tuesday tightening control and enforcement of firearms in the U.S., using his presidential powers in the absence of legal changes he implored Congress to pass. \u000aObama accused the gun lobby of taking Congress hostage, but said "they cannot hold America hostage." He insisted it was possible to uphold the Second Amendment while doing something to tackle the frequency of mass shootings in the U.S. that he said had become "the new normal." \u000aObama wiped tears from his cheeks as he spoke emotionally about the victims of gun violence. \u000a"This is not a plot to take away everybody's guns," Obama said in a ceremony in the East Room. "You pass a background check, you purchase a firearm. The problem is some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules." \u000aAt the centerpiece of Obama's plan is a more sweeping definition of gun dealers that the administration hopes will expand the number of sales subject to background checks. Under current law, only federally licensed gun dealers must conduct background checks on buyers. But at gun shows, websites and flea markets, sellers often skirt that requirement by declining to register as licensed dealers. So new federal guidance from the Obama administration clarified that it applies to anyone "in the business" of selling firearms. \u000aThe White House also put sellers on notice that the administration planned to strengthen enforcement \u2014 including deploying 230 new examiners the FBI will hire to process background checks. \u000aTo lend a personal face to the issue, the White House assembled a cross-section of Americans whose lives were altered by the nation's most searing recent gun tragedies, including former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and relatives of victims from Charleston, S.C., at Virginia Tech. Mark Barden, whose son was shot to death at Sandy Hook Elementary School, introduced the president with a declaration that "we are better than this." \u000aInvoking the words of Martin Luther King Jr., Obama said, "We need to feel the fierce urgency of now." \u000a

VPresident Barack Obama\u2019s proposed executive actions on gun violence were met with mixed reactions from Illinois politicians on Tuesday. Unsurprisingly, opposition and support for the measures fell along party lines. \u000aFollowing Obama\u2019s address to the nation, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., held a press conference with Ald. Willie Cochran (20th) in Englewood, one of Chicago\u2019s most crime-ridden neighborhoods, during which they praised the president\u2019s steps to strengthen and enforce gun laws. \u000aDurbin pointed out that Chicago led the U.S. in gun deaths with 468 in 2015, and that the number of shooting victims increased 13 percent over the year to a record 2,939. \u000a\u201cGo to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as I did just a few months ago. Ask them the following question: When you go to the most violent sections of the city of Chicago \u2014 where the most gun incidents and crimes are taking place and you gather the crime guns and check out where they came from \u2014 what do you find? Forty percent of the crime guns in the deadliest sections of Chicago come from gun shows in northwestern Indiana,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cWhy? There\u2019s no background check. They sell these guns in volumes and they sell ammunition. These gangsters fill up the trunks of their car, drive across the state line into the city of Chicago and you know what happens next. They are sold to anyone who can put the money up for the purchase and then they turn into deadly weapons.\u201d \u000aRepublican U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk on Sunday, before Obama unveiled his plan, seemed to avoid the partisan divide, saying in a tweet, \u201cThis year I supported keeping guns from suspected terrorists & called on POTUS to look at social media in background checks.\u201d \u000aHere\u2019s a list of statements from other Illinois politicians -- mostly congressmen who represent the suburbs and Chicago -- on Obama\u2019s gun control plans. See what your U.S. representative had to say. \u000a

VThat\u2019s the message that President Barack Obama is rightly sending to unlicensed gun sellers who have long flouted federal flaw with a wink. Now Washington will stop winking back. \u000aOf the new gun policies that Obama announced this week, the most important is his directive to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to clarify what it means to be \u201cengaged in the business\u201d of selling guns. This phrase, which comes from a 1986 law, matters because only those who regularly buy and resell firearms are required to obtain a sales license and conduct background checks on all buyers. Individuals who make only \u201coccasional sales\u201d from their personal collections are exempt. \u000aUnfortunately, the ATF has \u2014 under both Democratic and Republican presidents \u2014 allowed the phrase \u201coccasional sales\u201d to mean almost anything, which has rendered the background check system optional. Those who want to avoid a check can easily buy a new gun through an unlicensed vendor. \u000aA 2015 report by Everytown For Gun Safety (co-founded by Michael R. Bloomberg, majority owner of Bloomberg LP) found that a small group of unlicensed sellers were offering guns in high volumes \u2014 more than 25 guns a year, and as many as 150 \u2014 and the majority of those vendors met additional indications of illegally \u201cengaging in the business.\u201d \u000aThis sprawling universe of underground dealers fuels criminal activity by making it easy for felons and other dangerous people to buy guns and for traffickers to avoid detection. \u000aA gun purchased without a background check cannot be traced back to the buyer if it is recovered in a crime. \u000aThe best way to bring underground sellers into the regulated market\u2019s background check system is through legislation. But with Congress refusing to take up the issue, executive action is the next best thing. \u000aStill, it would have been better had Obama directed the ATF to formally define the meaning of \u201coccasional sales.\u201d Instead, the ATF will merely provide guidance to unlicensed gun sellers about what it means to be in compliance with the law. \u000aIt remains to be seen how much weight such guidance will carry with sellers \u2014 or with judges and juries. \u000aPolls consistently show that the vast majority of Americans, including gun owners, support background checks for all gun sales. As the president acknowledged on Tuesday, that\u2019s not going to happen during his presidency. Narrowing the \u201coccasional sales\u201d loophole is a start \u2014 a small but useful step that may, unfortunately, prove to be Obama\u2019s most significant legacy on gun safety. \u000a

VPresident Barack Obama on Tuesday outlined several modest and useful adjustments to gun-control policy. The modesty of the initiative is no fault of Obama\u2019s. On the contrary, he acted responsibly in not overstepping the bounds of his legal authority, and the changes that did result from a White House review of what is legally possible are worthwhile. But more fundamental reform must be accomplished by federal and state lawmakers. \u000aBoth sides of the fraught debate over guns had an interest in exaggerating the reach of these White House initiatives. The president naturally wants to depict the measures as bold action in the final year of his presidency. Republicans find it advantageous to decry them as a unilateral, unconstitutional abuse of executive power. The response of one official from the National Rifle Association may offer a better gauge: \u201cThis is it, really? This is what they\u2019ve been hyping for how long now?\u201d \u000aIn clarifying which gun-sellers under existing law are supposed to obtain federal firearms licenses (including those who operate on the Internet), the government aims to expand the number of gun buyers who are subject to criminal background checks. Also commendable are plans to encourage gun-safety research, improve the FBI background-check system by hiring more people and modernizing technology, and improve access to mental-health care. Obama also took steps that could encourage the development of \u201csmart gun technology,\u201d which could hasten the day in which gun triggers respond only to designated users, thus reducing the chances of accidental and criminal use. \u000aImprovements in background checks and mental-health care will depend on the willingness of the Republican-led Congress to appropriate necessary funds. Republicans deflect calls for gun control with the argument that mental health, not weaponry, is the unaddressed problem and root cause of violence; let\u2019s see if they will back up that rhetoric with appropriations. They should likewise welcome improvements to the operation of background checks that would better screen out bad actors while making it easier and faster for law-abiding citizens to get guns. \u000aBut we aren\u2019t holding our breath. As Obama observed Tuesday, the issue of guns has become one of the country\u2019s most polarized, partisan debates. \u201cHow did we get here?\u201dhe asked ruefully. Tears streamed down his face as he remembered the children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School. \u000aThe steps being taken by his administration move the country in the right direction, but in a rational world they would represent just the beginning of sensible reform. \u000a

VPresident Barack Obama on Tuesday outlined several modest and useful adjustments to gun-control policy. The modesty of the initiative is no fault of Obama\u2019s. On the contrary, he acted responsibly in not overstepping the bounds of his legal authority, and the changes that did result from a White House review of what is legally possible are worthwhile. But more fundamental reform must be accomplished by federal and state lawmakers. \u000aBoth sides of the fraught debate over guns had an interest in exaggerating the reach of these White House initiatives. The president naturally wants to depict the measures as bold action in the final year of his presidency. Republicans find it advantageous to decry them as a unilateral, unconstitutional abuse of executive power. The response of one official from the National Rifle Association may offer a better gauge: \u201cThis is it, really? This is what they\u2019ve been hyping for how long now?\u201d \u000aIn clarifying which gun-sellers under existing law are supposed to obtain federal firearms licenses (including those who operate on the Internet), the government aims to expand the number of gun buyers who are subject to criminal background checks. Also commendable are plans to encourage gun-safety research, improve the FBI background-check system by hiring more people and modernizing technology, and improve access to mental-health care. Obama also took steps that could encourage the development of \u201csmart gun technology,\u201d which could hasten the day in which gun triggers respond only to designated users, thus reducing the chances of accidental and criminal use. \u000aImprovements in background checks and mental-health care will depend on the willingness of the Republican-led Congress to appropriate necessary funds. Republicans deflect calls for gun control with the argument that mental health, not weaponry, is the unaddressed problem and root cause of violence; let\u2019s see if they will back up that rhetoric with appropriations. They should likewise welcome improvements to the operation of background checks that would better screen out bad actors while making it easier and faster for law-abiding citizens to get guns. \u000aBut we aren\u2019t holding our breath. As Obama observed Tuesday, the issue of guns has become one of the country\u2019s most polarized, partisan debates. \u201cHow did we get here?\u201dhe asked ruefully. Tears streamed down his face as he remembered the children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School. \u000aThe steps being taken by his administration move the country in the right direction, but in a rational world they would represent just the beginning of sensible reform. \u000a

VThat\u2019s the message that President Barack Obama is rightly sending to unlicensed gun sellers who have long flouted federal flaw with a wink. Now Washington will stop winking back. \u000aOf the new gun policies that Obama announced this week, the most important is his directive to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to clarify what it means to be \u201cengaged in the business\u201d of selling guns. This phrase, which comes from a 1986 law, matters because only those who regularly buy and resell firearms are required to obtain a sales license and conduct background checks on all buyers. Individuals who make only \u201coccasional sales\u201d from their personal collections are exempt. \u000aUnfortunately, the ATF has \u2014 under both Democratic and Republican presidents \u2014 allowed the phrase \u201coccasional sales\u201d to mean almost anything, which has rendered the background check system optional. Those who want to avoid a check can easily buy a new gun through an unlicensed vendor. \u000aA 2015 report by Everytown For Gun Safety (co-founded by Michael R. Bloomberg, majority owner of Bloomberg LP) found that a small group of unlicensed sellers were offering guns in high volumes \u2014 more than 25 guns a year, and as many as 150 \u2014 and the majority of those vendors met additional indications of illegally \u201cengaging in the business.\u201d \u000aThis sprawling universe of underground dealers fuels criminal activity by making it easy for felons and other dangerous people to buy guns and for traffickers to avoid detection. \u000aA gun purchased without a background check cannot be traced back to the buyer if it is recovered in a crime. \u000aThe best way to bring underground sellers into the regulated market\u2019s background check system is through legislation. But with Congress refusing to take up the issue, executive action is the next best thing. \u000aStill, it would have been better had Obama directed the ATF to formally define the meaning of \u201coccasional sales.\u201d Instead, the ATF will merely provide guidance to unlicensed gun sellers about what it means to be in compliance with the law. \u000aIt remains to be seen how much weight such guidance will carry with sellers \u2014 or with judges and juries. \u000aPolls consistently show that the vast majority of Americans, including gun owners, support background checks for all gun sales. As the president acknowledged on Tuesday, that\u2019s not going to happen during his presidency. Narrowing the \u201coccasional sales\u201d loophole is a start \u2014 a small but useful step that may, unfortunately, prove to be Obama\u2019s most significant legacy on gun safety. \u000a

VOn Monday, the White House announced a slate of executive actions the president is taking to address gun violence in America. \u000aObama's Tearful Speech on Why America Needs Gun Control, Now  \u000aSome people might say the measures "might not have stopped the last massacre or the one before that or the one before that, so why bother trying?" President Obama said Tuesday. "I reject that thinking. We know we can't stop every act of violence, every act of evil. But maybe we can stop one act or violence, one act of evil." \u000aDespite presenting them in relatively modest terms, Obama's directives \u2014 to reallocate resources, clarify rules and redouble existing efforts \u2014 could go a long way toward addressing issues that were at play in some of the high-profile mass shootings of the past decade, and a slew of other gun-related problems. \u000aOf course, it's impossible to say whether any particular tragedy could or would have been prevented if Obama's rules had been in effect. But these examples do shed light on some of the loopholes in U.S. gun laws that Obama is seeking to fix. \u000a1. The FBI will hire 230 additional personnel to process background checks, increasing its numbers in that arena by 50 percent. The agency is also partnering with the U.S. Digital Service to modernize its systems so it can process background checks 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \u000aWhy this matters: Two months before the 2015 shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, gunman Dylann Roof was arrested for possession of the drug Suboxone. That charge would have disqualified him from purchasing a gun if examiners from the FBI-run National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, had processed his application in time to catch it. Instead, the three-day waiting period imposed on firearms dealers in the U.S. expired without a decision, which meant that under federal law Roof was allowed to buy the .45-caliber Glock 41 he used to kill eight parishioners and the church's pastor, state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, during a Bible study session. \u000a2. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms will upgrade it systems and expand personnel, too. The ATF is budgeting $4 million to improve its ballistics database \u2014 to find links between crimes that take place in multiple jurisdictions \u2014 and will hire 200 new agents to enforce gun laws. \u000aObama also clarified the penalties dealers can face for violating those laws (for instance, for selling without a license or failing to conduct background checks): up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. And he clarified that the licensee shipping a gun is responsible for notifying law enforcement if the gun goes missing. \u000aWhy this matters: According to the White House , in the last half decade an average of 1,333 guns recovered in criminal investigations every year are traced back to a licensee who claimed he or she never received the gun, but who also failed to report the weapon lost or stolen. \u000a3. On Monday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch directed 93 U.S. attorneys to focus their resources on prosecuting gun crimes, with special attention paid to cases concerning "violent offenders, illegal firearms traffickers, and dangerous individuals who bypass the background check system to acquire weapons illegally." \u000aWhy this matters: During the push for increased gun regulations after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, NRA president Wayne LaPierre told Congress that the U.S. didn't need new gun laws \u2014 it needed to use the ones it had. "Prosecuting criminals who misuse firearms works," LaPierre said. "Unfortunately, we've seen a dramatic collapse in federal gun prosecutions in recent years." To a certain extent, he was right: According to a 2013 Syracuse University study , gun prosecutions dropped under Obama's administration, compared to George W. Bush's. \u000a2015: The Year in Mass Shootings  \u000a4. Lynch also issued a letter to the states emphasizing the importance of reporting "complete criminal history records and criminal dispositions, information on persons disqualified for mental health reasons, and qualifying crimes of domestic violence" to the federal government. \u000aWhy this matters: The shooter in the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, Seung-Hui Cho, passed two separate federal backgrounds checks in order to buy the two guns he used to kill 32 people and wound 17 others. The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence argued in the aftermath of the shooting that Cho shouldn't have passed either background check since a Virginia court ruled he was a danger to himself two years earlier. It's the state's responsibility to report "mental defectives" to the federal government; after Virginia Tech, Congress passed legislation incentivizing states to make more of their records available to NICS. \u000aThe same principle applies for cases of domestic violence. Last year, 15-year-old Jaylen Fryberg used a .40-caliber Beretta handgun, purchased by his father, to shoot four classmates and himself. The father, Raymond Lee Fryberg Jr., would have been prevented from buying the gun if the state of Washington had reported the fact that he was the subject of a domestic violence restraining order years earlier. \u000a5. Among the directives AG Lynch issued Monday was one asking U.S. attorneys' offices around the country to "renew" their efforts to combat domestic violence and keep abusers from buying guns. \u000aWhy this matters: Domestic violence and gun violence go hand-in-hand; the risk of homicide is 20 times higher in homes where both a gun and a history of domestic violence are present, and abused women are five times more likely to be killed by their abuser if that abuser owns a firearm. \u000a6. There are various methods to avoid background checks: one is to purchase a gun through a legal entity. Obama's executive orders change an ATF rule to require background checks for people trying to buy weapons and other items through a trust or corporation. \u000aWhy this matters: Former LAPD officer Christopher Dorner purchased through a trust the rifle and silencers he used to kill four people and himself during a weeklong rampage that terrorized three Southern California counties in 2013. Dorner wrote in his manifesto that all he needed to create the trust was access to the accounting software Quicken and $10 for a notary. \u000a7. Other ways to circumvent background checks include buying guns at gun shows and through some online retailers. Obama took a step to fix that on Monday by clarifying ATF rules to ensure all gun dealers \u2014 even those selling a small number of guns, and those selling online or at gun shows \u2014 obtain a license and conduct background checks. \u000aWhy this matters: Both James Holmes, the 2012 Aurora movie theater shooter, and Seung-Hui Cho purchased over the Internet the guns and ammunition they used during their shooting sprees. (That said, they both also passed background checks \u2014 despite their documented histories of mental health issues.) \u000a8. Obama asked the Social Security Administration to make sure Americans who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and those who are receiving benefits for mental health conditions, be entered into the federal background check database. He directed the Department of Health and Human Services to issue a directive confirming that states would not be violating privacy laws if they reported mental health issues to the federal database. Obama also proposed devoting $500 million toward expanding access to medical help for the mentally ill. \u000aWhy this matters: Gun advocates often say that the problem with gun violence is not access to weapons, but mental illness. In fact, an analysis of 21 studies found people who have mental illnesses are four times more likely to be the victims of violence than those who don't. Increased access to mental-health services could benefit both the would-be victims and would-be perpetrators of gun violence. \u000a9. Finally, Obama announced Monday that he is directing the Departments of Defense, Justice and Homeland Security to increase research and development to make it easier to track lost and stolen guns, and harder to use someone else's weapon or to accidentally discharge a gun. \u000aWhy this matters: Last year alone, 1,943 Americans were killed in accidental shootings, according to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive. \u000a

VEAU CLAIRE, Wis. (WEAU) -- President Obama issued executive orders to tighten the rules on gun control, which require anyone in the business of selling guns to do background checks on all buyers. \u000aIn an address, President Obama said background checks aren't required for many private sales, which he wants to change. \u000aThe president also plans to hire around 200 more examiners to help with the expected increase in background checks. \u000aBrian Zinn with General Coin & Gun Exchange in Eau Claire already works with people on going through the background check. \u000aHe said recently he's seen a lot more first time gun buyers, as well as an increase in gun sales overall. He said part of the recent increase in gun sales is because of the holiday season. \u000a"Some of the manufacturers have had huge inventories of firearms and they just flat lowered the price. Lower prices and the combination of some of the rhetoric you hear on TV has combined to increase sales," said Brian Zinn. \u000a"The president has clearly said this is just an extra safety measure, and I think given some of the tragedies we've had, additional safety isn't a bad thing. But that's not all the same thing as taking away someone's right to own guns and bear arms," said Beverly Wickstrom. \u000a

VHouston Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee joined President Barack Obama's push for new gun curbs Wednesday, introducing bills putting money and resources behind his calls for more mental health treatment and beefed up background checks for firearms purchases. \u000aOne measure would provide $500 million for mental health programs, including the reporting of disqualifying mental health information to the FBI's background check system. \u000aThe other authorizes the hiring of 200 additional ATF agents and investigators to help process background checks and enforce existing gun laws. \u000aObama included these specific requests in a new gun control initiative he announced Tuesday during an emotional appearance surrounded by shooting victims and their relatives. \u000aThe president's executive orders also would launch new research into smart gun technology and require gun dealers to report lost or stolen weapons. \u000aCongressional Republicans, however, have shown no interest in the White House plan, which conservatives deride as an assault on Americans' Second Amendment gun rights. \u000a"The President's commonsense steps cannot substitute for congressional action on gun violence," Jackson Lee said. "Congress must come together to build on the president's steps to curb gun violence." \u000a

VNeshoba County, Miss. Gun stores are already required to run background checks on their customers, but some gun show vendors do not. It has been called the gun show loophole. President Obama stressed that point during his executive order Tuesday, wanting all gun show vendors to be licensed. \u000aGun stores like Philadelphia Gun and Pawn say Obama's new gun control measures will be hard to enforce. \u000a"It's people coming into the gun shows, individuals not setting up venues, who are bringing their own firearms and possibly looking at trading stuff. That is where you don't have to run a background check, when it's just one individual to another. I don't see how they would enforce that," says Adam Moore, firearm salesman. \u000aMoore says he understands Obama's intent with gun control, but he doesn't believe it will curb gun violence. \u000a"Stricter gun control and gun laws, like I said are just going to hinder people that are law abiding citizens. It's going to make it harder for us and it's not going to do anything for those operating outside the law to continue crime." \u000aNancy Townsend, along with many others buying items at Philadelphia Gun and Pawn, says the gun show loophole is not the problem. She says criminals can acquire guns a number of ways. \u000a"They're going to get them on the black market or something, steal them. People use guns for safety and for protection and I don't think his laws are going to help one bit of the violence that goes on," says Townsend. \u000aOther gun control measures in the presidents executive action include hiring more people to run the FBI background check system and getting an additional $500 million from Congress to increase access to mental health care. \u000a

VWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama\u2019s plan to strengthen controls on guns in the U.S. is meeting swift resistance from gun rights groups, Republicans and even a few Democrats who say it\u2019s up to Congress to enact new policies on firearms. Yet the overall effect on gun violence could prove to be relatively small. \u000aSome questions and answers about Obama\u2019s presidential actions on gun control: \u000aWHAT ACTION IS OBAMA TAKING? \u000aObama announced a 10-point plan to try to keep guns from people who shouldn\u2019t have them. The centerpiece is new federal guidance that seeks to clarify who is \u201cin the business\u201d of selling firearms and has to get a federal license. \u000aLicensed dealers must run background checks on prospective buyers, but private sellers don\u2019t. Obama is aiming to narrow that loophole so that more firearms sold at gun shows, flea markets or online are subject to background checks. \u000aOther steps include 230 new examiners the FBI will hire to process background checks. And Obama is directing federal agencies to research smart gun technology to reduce accidental shootings and asking Congress for $500 million for mental health care. Further steps aim to better track lost guns and prevent trusts or corporations from buying dangerous weapons without background checks. \u000aI SELL A FEW GUNS FROM TIME TO TIME. DO I NEED TO REGISTER? \u000aThere\u2019s no cut-and-dry answer. \u000aThe new guidance says if your \u201cprincipal motive\u201d is profit, you\u2019re a dealer, but if you occasionally sell guns from your personal collection, you\u2019re not. Someone who only sells at gun shows or online can still be a dealer. \u000aThere\u2019s no specific number of guns that triggers a requirement to register. But the Justice Department is warning sellers that courts have convicted people for dealing without a license even when they\u2019ve sold as few as two guns. \u000aIt\u2019s up to individuals to look at the guidance and determine whether they need a license. The penalties for making the wrong call are steep: up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for those who deal firearms without a license. If you\u2019re not sure, you can contact the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \u000aWOULD THIS HAVE STOPPED RECENT MASS SHOOTINGS? \u000aAn Associated Press review shows that Obama\u2019s executive actions would have had no impact in keeping weapons from suspects in several of the deadliest incidents, including Newtown, Conn.; San Bernardino, Calif.; and Aurora, Colo. The shooters in Newtown and San Bernardino, for example, used weapons purchased by other people. \u000aObama\u2019s actions could potentially reduce other gun deaths \u2013 especially suicides, which cause two-thirds of gun deaths. But it\u2019s unclear whether the steps will significantly curb unregulated gun sales. \u000aMillions of guns are sold annually in informal settings outside of gun shops, including many through private sales arranged online. The Obama administration acknowledged it couldn\u2019t quantify how many gun sales would be newly subjected to background checks. Nor could it say how many currently unregistered gun sellers would have to obtain a license. \u000aObama is running out of time.

VOn Monday, the White House announced a slate of executive actions the president is taking to address gun violence in America. \u000aObama's Tearful Speech on Why America Needs Gun Control, Now  \u000aSome people might say the measures "might not have stopped the last massacre or the one before that or the one before that, so why bother trying?" President Obama said Tuesday. "I reject that thinking. We know we can't stop every act of violence, every act of evil. But maybe we can stop one act or violence, one act of evil." \u000aDespite presenting them in relatively modest terms, Obama's directives \u2014 to reallocate resources, clarify rules and redouble existing efforts \u2014 could go a long way toward addressing issues that were at play in some of the high-profile mass shootings of the past decade, and a slew of other gun-related problems. \u000aOf course, it's impossible to say whether any particular tragedy could or would have been prevented if Obama's rules had been in effect. But these examples do shed light on some of the loopholes in U.S. gun laws that Obama is seeking to fix. \u000a1. The FBI will hire 230 additional personnel to process background checks, increasing its numbers in that arena by 50 percent. The agency is also partnering with the U.S. Digital Service to modernize its systems so it can process background checks 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \u000aWhy this matters: Two months before the 2015 shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, gunman Dylann Roof was arrested for possession of the drug Suboxone. That charge would have disqualified him from purchasing a gun if examiners from the FBI-run National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, had processed his application in time to catch it. Instead, the three-day waiting period imposed on firearms dealers in the U.S. expired without a decision, which meant that under federal law Roof was allowed to buy the .45-caliber Glock 41 he used to kill eight parishioners and the church's pastor, state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, during a Bible study session. \u000a2. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms will upgrade it systems and expand personnel, too. The ATF is budgeting $4 million to improve its ballistics database \u2014 to find links between crimes that take place in multiple jurisdictions \u2014 and will hire 200 new agents to enforce gun laws. \u000aObama also clarified the penalties dealers can face for violating those laws (for instance, for selling without a license or failing to conduct background checks): up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. And he clarified that the licensee shipping a gun is responsible for notifying law enforcement if the gun goes missing. \u000aWhy this matters: According to the White House , in the last half decade an average of 1,333 guns recovered in criminal investigations every year are traced back to a licensee who claimed he or she never received the gun, but who also failed to report the weapon lost or stolen. \u000a3. On Monday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch directed 93 U.S. attorneys to focus their resources on prosecuting gun crimes, with special attention paid to cases concerning "violent offenders, illegal firearms traffickers, and dangerous individuals who bypass the background check system to acquire weapons illegally." \u000aWhy this matters: During the push for increased gun regulations after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, NRA president Wayne LaPierre told Congress that the U.S. didn't need new gun laws \u2014 it needed to use the ones it had. "Prosecuting criminals who misuse firearms works," LaPierre said. "Unfortunately, we've seen a dramatic collapse in federal gun prosecutions in recent years." To a certain extent, he was right: According to a 2013 Syracuse University study , gun prosecutions dropped under Obama's administration, compared to George W. Bush's. \u000a2015: The Year in Mass Shootings  \u000a4. Lynch also issued a letter to the states emphasizing the importance of reporting "complete criminal history records and criminal dispositions, information on persons disqualified for mental health reasons, and qualifying crimes of domestic violence" to the federal government. \u000aWhy this matters: The shooter in the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, Seung-Hui Cho, passed two separate federal backgrounds checks in order to buy the two guns he used to kill 32 people and wound 17 others. The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence argued in the aftermath of the shooting that Cho shouldn't have passed either background check since a Virginia court ruled he was a danger to himself two years earlier. It's the state's responsibility to report "mental defectives" to the federal government; after Virginia Tech, Congress passed legislation incentivizing states to make more of their records available to NICS. \u000aThe same principle applies for cases of domestic violence. Last year, 15-year-old Jaylen Fryberg used a .40-caliber Beretta handgun, purchased by his father, to shoot four classmates and himself. The father, Raymond Lee Fryberg Jr., would have been prevented from buying the gun if the state of Washington had reported the fact that he was the subject of a domestic violence restraining order years earlier. \u000a5. Among the directives AG Lynch issued Monday was one asking U.S. attorneys' offices around the country to "renew" their efforts to combat domestic violence and keep abusers from buying guns. \u000aWhy this matters: Domestic violence and gun violence go hand-in-hand; the risk of homicide is 20 times higher in homes where both a gun and a history of domestic violence are present, and abused women are five times more likely to be killed by their abuser if that abuser owns a firearm. \u000a6. There are various methods to avoid background checks: one is to purchase a gun through a legal entity. Obama's executive orders change an ATF rule to require background checks for people trying to buy weapons and other items through a trust or corporation. \u000aWhy this matters: Former LAPD officer Christopher Dorner purchased through a trust the rifle and silencers he used to kill four people and himself during a weeklong rampage that terrorized three Southern California counties in 2013. Dorner wrote in his manifesto that all he needed to create the trust was access to the accounting software Quicken and $10 for a notary. \u000a7. Other ways to circumvent background checks include buying guns at gun shows and through some online retailers. Obama took a step to fix that on Monday by clarifying ATF rules to ensure all gun dealers \u2014 even those selling a small number of guns, and those selling online or at gun shows \u2014 obtain a license and conduct background checks. \u000aWhy this matters: Both James Holmes, the 2012 Aurora movie theater shooter, and Seung-Hui Cho purchased over the Internet the guns and ammunition they used during their shooting sprees. (That said, they both also passed background checks \u2014 despite their documented histories of mental health issues.) \u000a8. Obama asked the Social Security Administration to make sure Americans who have been deemed a danger to themselves or others, and those who are receiving benefits for mental health conditions, be entered into the federal background check database. He directed the Department of Health and Human Services to issue a directive confirming that states would not be violating privacy laws if they reported mental health issues to the federal database. Obama also proposed devoting $500 million toward expanding access to medical help for the mentally ill. \u000aWhy this matters: Gun advocates often say that the problem with gun violence is not access to weapons, but mental illness. In fact, an analysis of 21 studies found people who have mental illnesses are four times more likely to be the victims of violence than those who don't. Increased access to mental-health services could benefit both the would-be victims and would-be perpetrators of gun violence. \u000a9. Finally, Obama announced Monday that he is directing the Departments of Defense, Justice and Homeland Security to increase research and development to make it easier to track lost and stolen guns, and harder to use someone else's weapon or to accidentally discharge a gun. \u000aWhy this matters: Last year alone, 1,943 Americans were killed in accidental shootings, according to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive. \u000a

VWASHINGTON (CNN) -- The nation's largest gun rights organization declined Wednesday to send official representatives to a nationally televised town hall with President Barack Obama on gun violence -- just days after the president reignited a discussion over this controversial topic. \u000a"The National Rifle Association sees no reason to participate in a public relations spectacle orchestrated by the White House," NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told CNN, which is moderating the live town hall Thursday evening in Virginia. The NRA strengthened its comment after initially saying the White House had "organized" the event. \u000aThe NRA, the most influential gun rights group in terms of political persuasion and financial contributions, boasts a membership of about five million people. \u000aA CNN spokesperson said that it was the network, not the White House, that proposed the idea of a town hall on guns, and noted the audience would be evenly divided between organizations that support the Second Amendment including NRA members as well as groups that back gun regulation. \u000aObama on Tuesday presented a renewed push for further gun regulations, including background checks for firearms purchases through the use of executive action. While pro-gun regulation activists heralded Obama's renewed interest in the issue, his actions have been called into question about whether they would truly help stem gun violence. \u000aOn the overall issue of gun control, 48% of Americans support stricter laws, while 51% were opposed, according a CNN/ORC poll released last month. \u000aThe NRA and Obama have been bitter enemies on the issue of new gun regulations -- each accusing the other of engaging in politics instead of working to find solutions to end gun violence. \u000aSome of the groups invited to attend the town hall, which will feature direct audience questioning of the president, include Gun Owners of America, American Firearms Retailers Association, Everytown for Gun Safety and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, among others. \u000a

VWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Barack Obama's plan to strengthen controls on guns in the U.S. is meeting swift resistance from gun rights groups, Republicans and even a few Democrats who say it's up to Congress to enact new policies on firearms. Yet the overall effect on gun violence could prove to be relatively small. \u000aSome questions and answers about Obama's presidential actions on gun control: \u000aWHAT ACTION IS OBAMA TAKING? \u000aObama announced a 10-point plan to try to keep guns from people who shouldn't have them. The centerpiece is new federal guidance that seeks to clarify who is "in the business" of selling firearms and has to get a federal license. \u000aLicensed dealers must run background checks on prospective buyers, but private sellers don't. Obama is aiming to narrow that loophole so that more firearms sold at gun shows, flea markets or online are subject to background checks. \u000aOther steps include 230 new examiners the FBI will hire to process background checks. And Obama is directing federal agencies to research smart gun technology to reduce accidental shootings and asking Congress for $500 million for mental health care. Further steps aim to better track lost guns and prevent trusts or corporations from buying dangerous weapons without background checks. \u000aI SELL A FEW GUNS FROM TIME TO TIME. DO I NEED TO REGISTER? \u000aThere's no cut-and-dry answer. \u000aThe new guidance says if your "principal motive" is profit, you're a dealer, but if you occasionally sell guns from your personal collection, you're not. Someone who only sells at gun shows or online can still be a dealer. \u000aThere's no specific number of guns that triggers a requirement to register. But the Justice Department is warning sellers that courts have convicted people for dealing without a license even when they've sold as few as two guns. \u000aIt's up to individuals to look at the guidance and determine whether they need a license. The penalties for making the wrong call are steep: up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for those who deal firearms without a license. If you're not sure, you can contact the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \u000aWOULD THIS HAVE STOPPED RECENT MASS SHOOTINGS? \u000aAn Associated Press review shows that Obama's executive actions would have had no impact in keeping weapons from suspects in several of the deadliest incidents, including Newtown, Connecticut; San Bernardino, California; and Aurora, Colorado. The shooters in Newtown and San Bernardino, for example, used weapons purchased by other people. \u000aObama's actions could potentially reduce other gun deaths \u2014 especially suicides, which cause two-thirds of gun deaths. But it's unclear whether the steps will significantly curb unregulated gun sales. \u000aMillions of guns are sold annually in informal settings outside of gun shops, including many through private sales arranged online. The Obama administration acknowledged it couldn't quantify how many gun sales would be newly subjected to background checks. Nor could it say how many currently unregistered gun sellers would have to obtain a license. \u000aObama is running out of time. With barely a year left in his presidency, he has to act quickly to roll out new policies, especially if he wants them to become ingrained and harder to rescind when the next president takes over. \u000aAfter the Newtown shooting, Obama in 2013 sought far-reaching, bipartisan legislation that went beyond background checks to ban certain assault-style weapons and cap the size of ammunition clips. When the effort collapsed in the Senate, the White House said it was working to identify every legal step he could take on his own. \u000aBut a more recent spate of gun-related atrocities, including in San Bernardino, California, spurred the administration to give the issue another look. \u000aCAN THE PRESIDENT DO THIS ALONE? \u000aObama says he can. Republicans and gun rights advocates say he can't. \u000aThe White House says Obama is acting fully within his legal authority, by clarifying existing laws that Congress has already passed. It's an argument Obama has used before when opposition in Congress has led him to take sweeping executive action on immigration, climate change and other issues. \u000aStill, Obama readily concedes the executive steps will be challenged in court. One likely option for opponents is to challenge Obama's authority to define what it means to be "engaged in the business" of selling guns, since that definition isn't laid out in the law. \u000a

VWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Barack Obama\u2019s move to tighten controls on guns could curb the unregulated buying and selling of weapons over the Internet and at gun shows. But the overall effect on violence in the United States could prove to be modest. \u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not ever going to be difficult to get a firearm, just like it\u2019s not ever going to be difficult to get illegal drugs,\u201d said James Jacobs, a New York University law school professor. \u201cWhat makes us think that we can now create a regime that will make guns hard to obtain for someone who wants to obtain them?\u201d \u000aThe president used his executive authority Tuesday to clarify that anyone \u201cin the business\u201d of selling firearms must obtain a federal license and conduct background checks on prospective buyers, regardless of where the sales take place. Currently, many private sellers online and at gun shows do not bother to get licenses, and weapons sales over the Internet have become a booming business. \u000aThe White House and others can\u2019t say how many transactions the step will block. But the new controls probably wouldn\u2019t have prevented several of the grisly mass shootings around the country that have led to demands for tighter gun laws. \u000aThe president\u2019s action \u201chas potential impact \u2014 the degree or the type, it\u2019s hard to predict,\u201d said University of Pennsylvania Professor Susan Sorenson, who studies violence prevention. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really important to acknowledge that we can\u2019t just have one change and expect that to change things wildly.\u201d \u000aFor one thing, studies have shown that criminals are more likely to get guns directly from friends or other social connections than at gun shows or flea markets. \u000aThe president also called for the hiring of more than 230 additional examiners and other staff to process the millions of background checks received annually. But even with added manpower, there\u2019s no way to completely eliminate human error like the clerical mistakes that allowed Dylann Roof, the young man charged in the Charleston, S.C., church massacre, to buy a weapon even though he should have been disqualified after an earlier drug arrest. \u000aThe White House did not set a threshold for the number of guns someone has to sell to be covered by the licensing and background check requirement. But it warned that people can be charged with a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison for selling as few as two firearms when there is evidence they are running a business, such as selling weapons in their original packaging and for a profit. \u000aTheresa O\u2019Rourke of Downers Grove, Ill., said she hopes Obama\u2019s action will deter illegal transactions that have deadly consequences. Her best friend, 36-year-old Jitka Vesel, was killed in 2011 by a stalker who had illegally purchased a gun from a seller he met through Armslist.com, an online gun site. The seller was sentenced to prison after pleading guilty to an illegal sale. \u000a\u201cPeople do it now because it\u2019s easy,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cBut if we say upfront that if you break the law and you are going to go to prison, most people are going to take a step back and say, \u2018You know what? It\u2019s not worth it.\u2019 \u201d \u000aShe and other gun control advocates said too many individuals make a living selling guns without obtaining the $150 license and following requirements to conduct background checks, keep detailed sales records and face federal inspections. \u000aPrivate sales \u2014 often carried out in person after Internet advertisements connect sellers and buyers \u2014 can be exploited by convicted felons, domestic abusers and others who cannot pass a background check, critics say. \u000aPrivate sales have increasingly gone online over the past decade, but precise data are hard to pin down. GunBroker.com, which calls itself the world\u2019s largest online auction site for firearms and accessories, says it has grown every year since 1999. It now boasts 750,000 active listings on any given day. Armslist claims 7 million site visits per month. \u000aOne in 20 guns advertised through Armslist last year was linked to an unlicensed seller who had listed at least 25 guns, according to recent research published by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group backed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. A 2013 investigation by that group\u2019s predecessor, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, found that more than 3 percent of potential buyers on Armslist had criminal records that would bar them from owning firearms. \u000aArmslist, which was founded after Craigslist banned gun ads in 2007, says in a disclaimer on its website that it doesn\u2019t get involved in transactions and that buyers and sellers must follow all state and federal laws. Still, guns sold through ads on the site have been linked to some fatal shootings. \u000aA lawsuit filed in October alleges that an abusive husband purchased a handgun through an Armslist ad and used it to kill his wife and two other women at a salon in suburban Milwaukee in 2012. The man, Radcliffe Haughton, was able to buy the gun even though a judge had issued a restraining order days earlier that should have made him ineligible. \u000aArmslist owner Jonathan Gibbon called Obama\u2019s moves \u201cwell-meaning but ultimately ineffective.\u201d He said many private sellers want to conduct background checks but are discouraged by a \u201ccostly and burdensome\u201d system. \u000a\u201cFurther scrutiny of law-abiding people will not stop criminals,\u201d he said. \u000a

VSo why did President Barack Obama implement a series of executive actions on guns Tuesday with the very real chance that a Republican successor would repeal them next year? \u000aEmbarking on his final year in the White House, Obama is looking to solidify his legacy. He wants to claim credit for doing something, anything, to help solve one of America\u2019s most vexing issues, even if it\u2019s just symbolic. Besides, many Democrats are no longer shying away from the contentious issue now that public opinion polls show that Americans support gun restrictions by wide margins. \u000aBut it\u2019s more than that: Mass shooting after mass shooting has left Obama fuming. \u000a\u201cLook at it from his perspective; this has got to be frustrating. There\u2019s little he can do,\u201d said George Edwards, a presidential scholar at Texas A&M University. \u201cBut when you\u2019re frustrated and you can\u2019t do anything else, you use the tools you have.\u201d \u000aObama\u2019s actions are much more modest than the ones he has urged Congress to pass with no success. \u000aHe will expand the number of background checks on gun purchases by requiring more sellers \u2014 including those at stores, gun shows and on the Internet \u2014 to get licenses. He will direct officials to conduct more gun research, urge more domestic violence prosecutions, keep better track of lost guns and make it easier for states to share mental health information. \u000aAides and activists also say that Obama, once reluctant to speak about the issue, will use his last year in office to launch a yearlong campaign urging states and localities to do what they can to curb gun violence, which leads to 30,000 deaths in the United States each year. \u000a\u201cEvery time I think about those kids, it gets me mad,\u201d said Obama, who openly wiped away tears Tuesday when speaking about the 20 first-graders killed in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. \u000aGun violence is one of the only issues that have led the usually unflappable president to show his emotions in public, from crying and cracking his voice to chastising lawmakers and leading a congregation in singing \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d \u000aAt the White House on Tuesday, Obama surrounded himself with victims of gun violence, including former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in Arizona in 2011, and Jennifer Pinckney, whose husband, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, was killed in Charleston last year. They interrupted his speech several times to applaud, and after he listed the names of cities that had endured mass shootings, some in the audience uttered: \u201cToo many, too many.\u201d \u000a\u201cCan you imagine what this must be like for him?\u201d said Jo Comerford, campaign director for MoveOn, a liberal group that has advocated for background checks for years. \u201cHe feels these gun deaths personally as a father, as a husband, as a man, as a president. He was coming home to a promise he made himself \u2014 and the nation \u2014 that he wanted to get this done.\u201d \u000aBut while advocates for gun restrictions praised Obama, some privately wondered why he\u2019d waited until his final year to act. They have been asking him to impose similar executive actions for years, most forcefully after the Newtown shooting. \u000a\u201cA lot of these ideas existed for several years,\u201d acknowledged Tim Daly, director for campaigns, guns and crime at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning research center that made similar recommendations in 2013 and has worked closely with the administration. \u000aWhite House officials repeatedly declined to say this week why Obama didn\u2019t act earlier. But a senior administration official who\u2019s knowledgeable about the process but isn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly said in December that some of the ideas under consideration now had been discussed in 2013 but \u201cdidn\u2019t get to closure\u201d for a number of reasons. \u000a\u201cThat was a sprint,\u201d a second official said. \u201cWhere we took a bunch of things that were out there and pushed them over the finish line.\u201d This time, the official said, \u201csome of these things are a lot more complex.\u201d \u000aDuring his first term, Obama avoided gun control, an issue that was unlikely to win him political points or bring him legislative success. \u000aBut after the Newtown shooting \u2014 which he describes as the worst day of his presidency \u2014 Obama implored Congress to act and signed two dozen mostly modest executive actions. After Congress failed to expand background checks, an angry Obama blasted lawmakers, calling it \u201ca pretty shameful day for Washington.\u201d \u000aSince then, the president has continued to visit with grieving families and has counseled communities torn apart by mass shootings. In October, after a shooting at an Oregon college left 10 dead, Obama told his aides to \u201cscrub\u201d the law to see whether more could be done. \u000aDemocratic political consultant Drew Lieberman said acting was a \u201cno-lose\u201d situation for Obama at this point in his presidency, when he has an eye on his legacy. \u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t get it done, he can be viewed as the guy who took a stand,\u201d he said. \u000aObama doesn\u2019t seem to mind that his announcement this week has pushed the hot-button issue to the front of the presidential campaign, even if it may hurt moderate Democrats in swing congressional districts. He said gun violence was \u201csomething we should politicize.\u201d \u000aRepublicans accused Obama of overreaching yet again and vowed to challenge him in court, which could delay the actions until after he leaves office next January. Already, his 2014 plan to defer deporting millions of immigrants who are in the country illegally is on hold as a legal battle wages on. \u000aSeveral GOP presidential candidates have pledged to undo Obama\u2019s actions if they are elected. \u000a\u201cNo matter what President Obama says,\u201d said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., \u201chis word does not trump the Second Amendment.\u201d \u000a

VWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Barack Obama\u2019s move to tighten controls on guns could curb the unregulated buying and selling of weapons over the Internet and at gun shows. But the overall effect on violence in the U.S. could prove to be modest. \u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not ever going to be difficult to get a firearm, just like it\u2019s not ever going to be difficult to get illegal drugs,\u201d said James Jacobs, a New York University law school professor. \u201cWhat makes us think that we can now create a regime that will make guns hard to obtain for someone who wants to obtain them?\u201d \u000aThe president used his executive authority Tuesday to clarify that anyone \u201cin the business\u201d of selling firearms must obtain a federal license and conduct background checks on prospective buyers, regardless of where the sales take place. Currently, many private sellers online and at gun shows do not bother to get licenses, and weapons sales over the Internet have become a booming business. \u000aThe White House and others can\u2019t say how many transactions the step will block or how much bloodshed it may prevent. \u000aBut the new controls probably wouldn\u2019t have prevented several of the grisly mass shootings around the country that have led to demands for tighter gun laws, and may affect only a fraction of the nation\u2019s 30,000 annual gun deaths. \u000aThe president\u2019s action \u201chas potential impact \u2014 the degree or the type, it\u2019s hard to predict,\u201d said University of Pennsylvania professor Susan Sorenson, who studies violence prevention. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really important to acknowledge that we can\u2019t just have one change and expect that to change things wildly.\u201d \u000aFor one thing, studies have shown that criminals are more likely to get guns directly from friends or other social connections than at gun shows or flea markets. \u000aThe president also called for the hiring of more than 230 additional examiners and other staff to process the millions of background checks received annually. But even with added manpower, there\u2019s no way to completely eliminate human error like the clerical mistakes that allowed Dylann Roof, the young man charged in the Charleston, South Carolina, church massacre, to buy a weapon even though he should have been disqualified after an earlier drug arrest. \u000aThe White House did not set a threshold for the number of guns someone has to sell to be covered by the licensing and background check requirement.

The man, Radcliffe Haughton, was able to buy the gun even though a judge had issued a restraining order days earlier that should have made him ineligible. He went online to say he was \u201clooking to buy ASAP,\u201d and made the purchase in the parking lot of a McDonald\u2019s, the lawsuit says. \u000aArmslist owner Jonathan Gibbon called Obama\u2019s moves \u201cwell-meaning but ultimately ineffective.\u201d He said many private sellers want to conduct background checks but are discouraged by a \u201ccostly and burdensome\u201d system that requires them to go to licensed dealers and pay fees. \u000a\u201cFurther scrutiny of law-abiding people will not stop criminals,\u201d he said. \u000aEverytown president John Feinblatt called the clarification a welcome if modest step. \u000a\u201cIt puts them on notice and, if accompanied with aggressive enforcement, has the potential to narrow the number of unlicensed dealers who are selling without background checks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even so, millions of guns will be sold online without background checks unless Congress or states pass universal background checks, as 18 states have done on their own.\u201d \u000aThe Obama administration appeared determined to tamp down expectations, with Obama saying he realizes his actions won\u2019t stop all gun violence. \u000a\u201cObviously the president is not able to take strong measures because that\u2019s going to require Congress to act,\u201d said Philip Cook, a Duke University professor. \u201cBut if he is able to disrupt a relative handful of sales and save a handful of lives, that may well be worthwhile.\u201d \u000aHe added: \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at here is a low-cost intervention with the possibility of some payoff.\u201d \u000a

VAs President Barack Obama wiped away tears during an address in which he condemned gun violence across the US and announced new steps his administration will take to tighten gun controls , scores of gun owners have provided their own arguments as to why America should be the land of the free. \u000aAnd some of them are, quite frankly, outrageous. We\u2019re not sure whether to laugh or cry. \u000aAccording to the pro-gun lobby, everything and anything is responsible for gun deaths \u2014 except guns. But those pesky illegal aliens are up there at the top. \u000aAnd it\u2019s not just the average Joe taking issue. \u000a\u201cThe President\u2019s actions have everything to do with advancing his political agenda and little to do with actually protecting American citizens,\u201d Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said after Obama\u2019s speech. \u000a\u201cAny executive order President Obama signs that regulates firearms transactions will merely regulate the freedom of law abiding citizens.\u201d \u000aHe\u2019s not the only one. \u000aTexas Senator and fellow Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz said Obama\u2019s action plan to more tightly regulate gun sales wasn\u2019t worth the paper it was written on. \u000a\u201dWhen you live by the pen, you die by the pen,\u201d Cruz said, adding that his own pen \u201chas an eraser on it.\u201d \u000aPresident Obama has even been accused of lying his way through the speech, with editor of the BearingArms website, Jim Owens, calling it his \u201cmost deplorable performace yet.\u201d \u000a\u201cThe lame duck President has a wretched and deplorable habit of making emotional arguments because the facts clearly are not on his side,\u201d Owens wrote. \u000a\u201cObama can turn on the fake tears and grandstand to his heart\u2019s desire, but he will not achieve his goal of gutting the Second Amendment in his final year in office.

VAs President Barack Obama wiped away tears during an address in which he condemned gun violence across the US and announced new steps his administration will take to tighten gun controls , scores of gun owners have provided their own arguments as to why America should be the land of the free. \u000aAnd some of them are, quite frankly, outrageous. We\u2019re not sure whether to laugh or cry. \u000aAccording to the pro-gun lobby, everything and anything is responsible for gun deaths \u2014 except guns. But those pesky illegal aliens are up there at the top. \u000aAnd it\u2019s not just the average Joe taking issue. \u000a\u201cThe President\u2019s actions have everything to do with advancing his political agenda and little to do with actually protecting American citizens,\u201d Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said after Obama\u2019s speech. \u000a\u201cAny executive order President Obama signs that regulates firearms transactions will merely regulate the freedom of law abiding citizens.\u201d \u000aHe\u2019s not the only one. \u000aTexas Senator and fellow Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz said Obama\u2019s action plan to more tightly regulate gun sales wasn\u2019t worth the paper it was written on. \u000a\u201dWhen you live by the pen, you die by the pen,\u201d Cruz said, adding that his own pen \u201chas an eraser on it.\u201d \u000aPresident Obama has even been accused of lying his way through the speech, with editor of the BearingArms website, Jim Owens, calling it his \u201cmost deplorable performace yet.\u201d \u000a\u201cThe lame duck President has a wretched and deplorable habit of making emotional arguments because the facts clearly are not on his side,\u201d Owens wrote. \u000a\u201cObama can turn on the fake tears and grandstand to his heart\u2019s desire, but he will not achieve his goal of gutting the Second Amendment in his final year in office.

VSo President Obama graced his loyal subjects with another speech Tuesday, finally talking about proposed executive actions on gun control that the White House has been working on for months. With some tears, not quite sure if they were the crocodile variety or not, the president talked about recent shooting tragedies such as Newton and Sandy Hook. \u000aSuch tragedies are extremely sad, and beyond rational thought. But the president likes to use tragedies to advance his political cause, and this is not the first time during his tenure that has been the case. \u000aRegardless of how noble his cause, the president continues to advance his agenda in the wrong way. We have a system in this country. Laws are passed by Congress, not the Executive Branch. And like President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, these on gun control will go over with the American people just as badly. \u000aIf Americans were clamoring for gun control, or any of the President\u2019s other list of wishes for that matter, then they wouldn\u2019t have overwhelmingly elected Republicans to Congress and statehouses to block his agenda. The president is not empowered to make an end run around Congress just because he has not found a way to get along or negotiate with them. \u000aThe president showed a little bit of attitude when talking about politicians and lobbyists that are pro-gun, saying \u201cI taught constitutional law. I know a little bit about this, I get it.\u201d He also berated lawmakers on Capitol Hill for not doing more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and said, \u201cThe gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage right now but they are not holding America hostage.\u201d \u000aGun control is a tough issue in this country, and not just because of the National Rifle Association or any of the other pro-gun ownership groups. The Second Amendment to the Constitution, along with the other nine that make up the Bill of Rights, were enshrined as unalienable rights, granted by God to man, that no government can take away. \u000aI am among the many Americans who feel that if you do not have the right to protect and defend yourself against the government, the rest of the rights in the Constitution do not mean much. \u000aThis is important. We don\u2019t have a right to own guns to defend ourselves from criminals, to hunt, or any other reason. These are secondary rights we have in relation to guns. We have the right to bear arms against a tyrannical government. The founders knew that without weapons, a civilization or society could be enslaved or wiped out by the very government that was tasked to protect it. \u000aWe in California have some of the strictest gun laws in the nation, with no sign of slowing down. New laws are being passed here every year. Many of the executive actions that the administration wants to enact have already been law in California. The inconvenience to law-abiding gun owners in this state is ridiculous. \u000aInstead of working in the system to pass laws on a state by state basis, once again the president thinks that a blanket national policy is the answer. \u000aWe are a nation of individual states - each with their own climate, economy and culture. Part of the brilliance of the United States is that one can move to a different state and live a life that is 180 degrees different than that left behind. What works in one area may not actually work so well elsewhere. \u000aMost of us in rural areas have common sense about weapons. They are a tool - for livelihood, food, protection. We teach our children and grandchildren to respect the power they have in their hands when they pick up a gun. We lock them up when not in use, we answer questions that our kids have about them so there isn\u2019t curiosity, we are responsible about our gun ownership. \u000aDo I believe we have a problem with those who own legally obtained weapons? Not really. There will always be people who look for a way to game the system, but you can not legislate around outlying behaviors to curtail the rights of all. \u000aWhat\u2019s so wrong with actually enforcing the laws we have on the books, rather than constantly passing new laws that get ignored? \u000aCriminals who want to get guns will do so, and usually not through the background check/waiting period currently in place now. The recent shooting in San Bernadino can attest to that. The primary weapons used in that shooting were obtained through illegal means with a straw purchaser. \u000aSo now I should have a harder time trying to buy a gun? Yeah, that makes perfect sense! \u000aI doubt many of the executive actions will make it past our judicial system. There has already been talk of gun advocates challenging the administration in court. I would figure that they will be tied up in litigation for the next few years, and if a Republican wins the White House in 2016 I would expect them to overturn these actions rather soon after taking up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. \u000a

VThe new measures to stem gun violence announced Tuesday by President Barack Obama were greeted in some quarters while slammed in others. \u000a(The measures are detailed at: https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/01/05/fact-sheet-new-executive-actions-reduce-gun-violence-and-make-our ) \u000aVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said the measures \u201care designed to protect all citizens from gun violence by fully enforcing existing laws and taking reasonable steps to keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals.\u201d He said it would be a a violation of the public trust to ignore the pleas of those who lost family members to gun violence for meaningful protections. \u000a\u201cIf these measures prevent a single family from going through the agony that so many Virginians have experienced, they will be worthwhile,\u201d McAuliffe said. \u000aRepublican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said in advance of the president's announcement, \u201cIn America we believe in the Constitution _ not confiscations, dictatorships or kings, and Obama\u2019s newest assault on the Second Amendment is a blatant, belligerent abuse of power. I will never apologize for my firearms, my ammunition or my concealed carry license. I will never apologize for defending your right to have the same. I will never apologize for protecting myself, my family or my friends. I will never apologize for supporting and defending the Constitution of the United States from all enemies, foreign and domestic. And I will never bow down and surrender to Obama\u2019s unconstitutional, radical, anti-gun agenda. Washington is out-of-control, and it\u2019s time for a president that puts Americans first." \u000aVirginia Del. Bob Marshall, whose 13th District includes part of Prince William County and Manassas Park, said that \u201cBarack Obama can enforce his own rules.Virginia is under no constitutional obligation to enforce Barack Obama\u2019s executive efforts at restricting Second Amendment Rights.\u201d \u000aAnticipating the president's actions, Marshall filed HB 83 to prevent the Commonwealth of Virginia or its localities from assisting those actions without congressional authority and \u201ceven in defiance of Congress,\u201d he said. \u000a\u201cObama failed to tell us how his executive orders would have prevented the violence he cites as justification for his unilateral and select disarming of American citizens who have committed no crime,\u201d Marshall said. \u000a\u201cYes, some actions proposed by President Obama are within his powers such as hiring FBI employees. Clearly, some of his acts require legislative powers which belong only to Congress and /or the state legislatures, not Presidents or Governors,\u201d the delegate said. \u000a\u201cIn the absence of more details or a better explanation, Obama\u2019s proposal seems to require all persons who sell even a single firearm to have a federal license which would effectively prevent a citizen from selling his firearms through a licensed dealer without themselves having to get a federal firearms license!,\u201d the delegate said. \u000aYou must be registered and logged in to comment.

VWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 Yesterday, Congresswoman Katherine Clark (who represents Winchester) applauded President Obama\u2019s announcement that the Administration will take executive action to help reduce and prevent gun violence in America. In November, Clark and her Democratic colleagues sent a letter to the White House urging President Obama to close the background check loophole through executive action. \u000a\u201cPresident Obama is using his executive power to take important steps to curb gun violence, and I applaud him for these efforts,\u201d said Congresswoman Clark. \u201cBut the work to end the epidemic of gun violence in this country does not end there. Congress must act to close the remaining loopholes that allow domestic abusers, convicted criminals, and the dangerously mentally ill to buy guns and endanger our communities.\u201d \u000aThe executive actions announced by the president yesterday will make significant progress in the ongoing struggle to curb gun violence: \u000a\u2022 Toughening background checks nationwide: The president\u2019s executive actions provide new guidance on existing federal laws, clarifying that any individual in the business of selling firearms must obtain a license through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and therefore conduct background checks on prospective gun purchasers. These actions also include new measures and resources to make the background check system more efficient and effective. \u000a\u2022 Protecting communities with bolstered enforcement: The executive actions take new steps to promote smart and effective enforcement of gun laws \u2013 including a proposed increase in funding for more ATF agents, greater resources for tracking illegal online firearms trafficking and strengthened domestic violence outreach efforts. \u000a\u2022 Improving mental health services: The president is proposing increased investment to expand access to mental health care. Further, the executive actions remove barriers that prevent the reporting of relevant mental health information to the background check system. \u000a\u2022 Driving new research into gun safety: The executive actions direct the Departments of Defense, Justice and Homeland Security to conduct or sponsor research into new technology to make firearms safer. \u000aThe president\u2019s executive actions come after the Republican Congress has repeatedly refused to allow votes on commonsense, bipartisan gun violence prevention legislation \u2013 including acting on seven separate occasions to block a vote on a Republican Congressman\u2019s legislation to close the outrageous terror gun loophole that allows suspected terrorists to buy deadly weapons across America. \u000aStudies show that every day where background checks are used, the system stops more than 170 felons, some 50 domestic abusers, and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun. However, no system is in place to prevent these same prohibited purchasers from buying identical guns at a gun show, over the internet, or through a newspaper ad with no questions asked \u2013 because background checks are not required for these kinds of sales. The King-Thompson bill closes these outrageous, dangerous loopholes. \u000a

VWashington Gov. Jay Inslee says plans to take executive action to curb gun violence. \u000aIn an announcement Wednesday, the Democrat said his efforts will focus on suicide prevention and research into gun injuries and deaths in the state. \u000aHe said his announcement was inspired in part by President Barack Obama's gun initiative announced earlier in the week. \u000aThe president plans to take executive action to tighten control and enforcement of firearms in the U.S. Obama's plan creates a more sweeping definition of gun dealers that the administration hopes will expand the number of sales subject to background checks. \u000aWashington state already has expanded background checks to include online sales and purchases made at gun shows as a result of a 2014 voter-approved ballot measure. \u000a

VLike many Americans, Dixie Mitchell sees President Obama's new gun control plans as "basically taking away guns from us." \u000a"I don't agree with that," said the 40-year-old downtown bartender. \u000aObama unveiled his proposals during an emotional national address Tuesday. He said he believes in the Second Amendment that guarantees the right to bear arms, and that the country can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with it. \u000aThe president introduced a 10-point plan that includes some actions by executive power, and acknowledged other parts won't be done before he leaves office because they'll have to go through Congress. The key piece of his plan would narrow a loophole exempting gun sales from background checks if the seller isn't a federally registered dealer. \u000a"People that need them should have every right to get them," Mitchell said. "But people that don't need them - there should be stronger background checks. It's because they're putting them in the wrong hands. It should be harder." \u000aRex Smith, a 51-year-old event planner, agrees with Obama. \u000a"We really need to do something about gun control," he said during a brief break from his work inside the Metropolitan Room. "I feel like there are too many guns going out to too many people just for the sport. And then those guns are being turned around and sold for profit in the street to people who can't get a permit to get a handgun." \u000aSmith said he's uncomfortable when he enters a restaurant and finds himself surrounded by five people carrying handguns on their hips. Obama, he said, has got the right idea, trying to make it harder for citizens to obtain handgun permits. \u000a"Obama can try to change all the rules he wants to change," he said, "but nothing's going to change until people change their ethics on how they look at life and what life means to everyone." \u000aMilitary members asked about the president's plan declined to comment. \u000aIrwin Sellers, 65, and a salesman at Powers Swain Chevrolet, described the president's initiative as "overkill" while he ate lunch at Robertson's in Eutaw Village Shopping Center. \u000aSellers volunteered that he didn't vote for Obama, and he said he disagrees with the announced plans for stricter gun control laws. "I think if you take weaponry away from law-abiding citizens - people who want them are going to get guns." \u000aAs a college student, 19-year-old Rachel Brittain said tighter gun controls would make her feel more comfortable on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u000a"I think we need that," she said. "We founded this country on the Second Amendment. I think background checks do help with that. How society is - people are taking advantage of that (access to weapons). \u000a"I think this is good middle ground," Brittain concluded. \u000aOne 54-year-old business owner, a veteran who requested anonymity, said there needed to be a level of gun control but vowed to protect himself if necessary. He questioned how far the president would go on control measures. \u000aChelan Wongus, 22, and a psychology major at Virginia Union University, said she's behind the president 100 percent. \u000a"I don't understand why Congress isn't behind this," she said while waiting for her boyfriend to exit an Air Force recruiting office in Eutaw. "They're saying it takes away our right to bear arms. It's not taking away our right, but giving us extra protection for that right." \u000aStaff writer Michael Futch can be reached at futchm@fayobserver.com or 486-3529. \u000a

VWASHINGTON \u2013 Democratic lawmakers including Sen. Elizabeth Warren called President Barack Obama\u2019s order tightening background checks for gun sales a \u201ccommon-sense\u201d measure, saying it was necessary only because the Republican Congress has failed to act. \u000a\u201cThe Republican-controlled Congress has had all the time in the world to control gun violence,\u201d Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said during a call with reporters Wednesday afternoon organized by the White House. \u000a\u201cIf the Republican Party would rather work for NRA than the American people, then someone else has to show up,\u201d she said. \u000aWarren\u2019s own party has not been unified on the issue, however. Five Senate Democrats helped defeat a 2013 bill that would have required background checks for sales at gun shows. \u000aComments by Warren and other Democrats came as the Obama administration began down the path of selling the reforms to the public. \u000aHis order clarifies that background checks are required for sales online at at gun shows if the seller is in the business of firearms sales. Obama is scheduled to take part in a televised town hall on the issue on CNN on Thursday night. \u000aObama\u2019s changes were blasted by gun groups, as well as many Republicans who objected to his circumventing Congress by executive order. \u000aRepublicans in Congress have said they will scrutinize how the changes are being carried out. Some have vowed to oppose Obama\u2019s funding request for more agents in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to carry out background checks, and for increased mental health counseling and reporting. \u000aWarren, though, said more needs to be done. She told campaign supporters in an email Tuesday that Congress still needs to ban assault weapons with high-capacity magazines, make gun trafficking a federal crime, and write Obama\u2019s executive order into law so that the next president cannot undo it. \u000a\u201cI\u2019m ready to have that fight for reform right now and right here,\u201d she said during the call. \u000aWarren said the federal action was needed despite already tough background check laws in her state. \u000a\u201cStrong laws in Massachusetts won\u2019t stop someone from going to a gun show in a state with weak laws and bring guns back into Massachusetts.\u201d \u000aRep. Seth Moulton, D-Massachusetts, said on the call that \u201cguns saved my life\u201d while serving four tours in Iraq as a Marine Corps infantry officer. \u000a\u201cBut I also witnessed gun violence firsthand,\u201d he said, \u201cand I know there\u2019s no place for that in schools or communities here in America.\u201d \u000aMoulton said the majority of Americans \u2013 including members of the National Rifle Association \u2013 support increased screening in gun purchases. \u000aObama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said during the call that 300,000 people who die each year from gun violence aren\u2019t only victims of highly publicized mass shootings. \u000aThose cases, she said, involve \u201cdomestic violence, gang shootings. There were accidents, often involving children.\u201d \u000aTwo-thirds of the deaths were suicides, she noted. \u000a\u201cWe simply cannot afford this kind of carnage in this country,\u201d she said. \u000aDoug DuBois Jr., executive director of the Texas State Rifle Association, in a statement on Wednesday also criticized Obama for circumventing Congress. \u000a\u201cThese executive actions taken by the Obama administration are another sign that this administration is more interested in vilifying law-abiding gun owners than actually trying to prevent criminals from getting their hands on firearms,\u201d he said. \u000a\u201cRather than point to the success in reducing violent crime over the past decade and reinforcing the need for strengthening the (background check) system with additional agents, the executive actions are a test to circumvent the legislative process,\u201d he said. \u000a

VSIERRA VISTA \u2014 Local reactions to Tuesday\u2019s announcement by President Obama of several executive actions pertaining to gun control were mixed. \u000aAmong the president\u2019s comments from the East Room of the White House were plans to require more gun sellers, especially those who do business on the Internet and at gun shows, to be licensed and would force them to conduct background checks on potential buyers. \u000aMike Benson, owner of Trail Boss Guns, said he agreed that those who regularly sell guns should be required to have a Federal Firearms License to do so. \u000a\u201cFor folks like that, folks doing gun shows each week, or swap meets every week, they\u2019re involved in the business and should be licensed,\u201d Benson said. However, the idea that an individual looking to sell one or two guns also needs a license is unnecessary. \u000a\u201cIt\u2019s burdensome,\u201d he said. \u000aSome of the president\u2019s orders may even help gun shops do more business, particularly his intention to hire more than 230 additional personnel for the FBI\u2019s processing of background checks for firearms sales. \u000a\u201cWe call the FBI when we do background checks of every gun sale,\u201d said Jim Adams, owner of Apocalypse Arms and Military Surplus. The wait times on those calls can last well over 30 minutes. \u201cInstead of getting put on hold, we call it getting put on ignore.\u201d \u000aEfforts to help increase the efficiency of those background checks are welcome. \u000a\u201cHaving more people to do those background checks for us would be great, because that would expedite things for us,\u201d Adams said. \u000aAnother comment that caught Adams\u2019 ear was the president\u2019s proposal for a $500 million investment in mental health access and how it would be funded. \u000a\u201cSounds like a tax to me,\u201d he said, before adding, \u201cObviously I\u2019m not in support of any new taxes aimed at guns or ammunition. I think that\u2019s a way to circumvent the gun control issue.\u201d \u000aThose most concerned about gun control are not criminals with ill intent, Adams said, but rather law-abiding citizens who fear that restrictive laws will prevent them from being able to protect themselves or their loved ones. \u000a\u201cEvery time the government starts talking about gun control, we get customers in here buying guns. These are people passing background checks,\u201d he said. \u201cI had one gentlemen come in here, and it was interesting, he said he didn\u2019t like guns, didn\u2019t own a gun, and didn\u2019t want one, until the government said he wouldn\u2019t be able to get one.\u201d \u000aDavid Greenberg, owner of the Second Amendment Family Gunshop in Bisbee, called Obama\u2019s comments \u201casinine.\u201d \u000aHe added, \u201cI had to pull off the road three or four times because I was listening to it on the radio.\u201d \u000aThe president, in his comments, perpetuated long-disproven facts about firearms, Greenberg said. \u000a\u201cIt was a series of just bad facts, facts that I have seen before and that have been disproved over and over again. The basic point is that nothing he said today would have changed any of the mass murders that have occurred,\u201d he said. \u000a

VThe apologists for the weapons industry\u2014they pass themselves off as the gun rights movement\u2014demonstrate their intellectual bankruptcy by regularly contradicting themselves with a straight face. \u000aREAD: GOP Consultant for a Day \u000aOn the one hand, President Obama\u2019s modest initiatives to keep guns out of the wrong hands are denounced as an outlandish abuse of his executive powers. House Speaker Paul Ryan showed why the Republican far right has such faith in him by declaring that Obama\u2019s \u201cwords and actions amount to a form of intimidation that undermines liberty.\u201d Accusing a president of undermining liberty is a nice way of encouraging those who see him as a dictator. \u000aYet there was the National Rifle Association itself making fun of Obama\u2019s actions for being puny. \u201cThis is it, really?\u201d said the NRA\u2019s Jennifer Baker. \u201cThey\u2019re not really doing anything.\u201d The same NRA put up a frightening online video declaring that Obama is \u201cour biggest threat to national security.\u201d So a president who\u2019s \u201cnot really doing anything\u201d is also a menacing tyrant. \u000aThis is an old trick on the part of those who will not budge, no matter how many Americans are killed by firearms. Their favorite ploy is to say that since there are already so many guns out there\u2014some estimates run to over 300 million\u2014no particular practical measure will do much of anything to stem the violence. It\u2019s hard to know the exact number, by the way, partly because the NRA and its congressional enablers impede gun research. \u000aBut as soon as the weapons extremists have said that sane action is useless in the face of so many guns, they turn around and assert that those who support universal background checks and other small steps are secretly in favor of gun confiscation. Wait a minute: In one breath, they are implying, against all their other assertions, that the problem really is too many guns; in the next, they are condemning those who propose any regulations as would-be despots who want to disarm the country\u2014the only thing their own rhetoric suggests would make a real difference. Welcome to a new philosophical concept: circular illogic. \u000aThat the gun lobby has managed to make this con game work so well for so long is a national scandal, and it drove the president to tears on Tuesday. \u000aBut something important happened in the East Room when Obama offered a series of constrained but useful steps toward limiting the carnage on our streets, in our schools and houses of worship, and at our movie theaters. He made clear that the era of cowering before the gun lobby and apologizing, trimming, hedging and equivocating is over. \u000aOn the policy front, his commitment to innovative gun safety technology that would confine the use of a weapon to its owner has exceptional promise. What have come to be known as \u201csmart guns\u201d could reduce the use of stolen weapons in crime and also prevent accidents. Obama made a point every parent can relate to: \u201cIf a child can\u2019t open a bottle of aspirin, we should make sure that they can\u2019t pull a trigger on a gun.\u201d Someone should ask Speaker Ryan if such safety measures for drugs or guns undermine our liberties. \u000aAnd when it came to the politics of guns, Obama drew lines as he has never drawn them before. He explicitly called out the \u201c90 percent of Republicans in the Senate\u201d who opposed universal background checks in the fateful roll call after the Newtown massacre. As Obama put it, advocates of gun reform will need to \u201cfind the courage to vote\u201d on the issue, and also have \u201cthe courage to get mobilized and organized.\u201d \u000a\u201cAll of us,\u201d he said, \u201cneed to demand a Congress brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby\u2019s lies.\u201d \u000aObama isn\u2019t running for re-election, but the 2016 Democratic presidential candidates have shown that they, too, are unafraid to take on those who remain unmoved by death after death. At this point, Democrats have little to lose. Only fearlessness will flip the politics of guns and begin to put Republicans on the defensive. Surely some in the GOP know that their party cannot forever embrace an irrational absolutism that leaves the country powerless before unconscionable carnage. \u000aBullies are intimidating until someone calls their bluff. By ruling out any reasonable steps toward containing the killing in our nation and by offering ever more preposterous arguments, the gun worshipers are setting themselves up for wholesale defeat. It will take time. But it will happen. \u000aE.J. Dionne\u2019s email address is ejdionne@washpost.com. Twitter: @EJDionne. \u000a

VWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Tears streaking his cheeks, President Barack Obama launched a final-year push Tuesday to tighten sales of firearms in the U.S., using his presidential powers in the absence of tougher gun restrictions that Congress has refused to pass. \u000aThe president struck a combative tone as he came out with plans for expanded background checks and other modest measures that have drawn consternation from gun rights groups, which Obama accused of making Congress their hostage. Palpable, too, was Obama\u2019s extreme frustration at having made such little progress on gun control since the killing of 20 first-graders in Connecticut confronted the nation more than three years ago. \u000a\u201cFirst-graders,\u201d Obama said woefully, resting his chin on his hand and wiping away tears as he recalled the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. \u201cEvery time I think about those kids, it gets me mad.\u201d \u000aObama\u2019s 10-point plan to keep guns from those who shouldn\u2019t have them marked a concession by the president: He\u2019ll leave office without securing the new gun control laws he\u2019s repeatedly and desperately implored Congress to pass. \u000aAlthough Obama, acting alone, can take action around the margins, only Congress can enact more sweeping changes that gun control advocates say are the only way to truly stem the frequency of mass shootings. \u000a\u201cIt won\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen during this Congress. It won\u2019t happen during my presidency.\u201d But, he added optimistically, \u201ca lot of things don\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d \u000aThe National Rifle Association, the largest gun group, panned Obama\u2019s plan and said it was \u201cripe for abuse,\u201d although the group didn\u2019t specify what steps, if any, it will take to oppose or try to block it. Even Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat and gun-owner who co-wrote the bipartisan bill Obama supported in 2013, took issue with the president\u2019s move. \u000a\u201cInstead of taking unilateral executive action, the president should work with Congress and the American people, just as I\u2019ve always done, to pass the proposals he announced today,\u201d Manchin said. \u000aThe centerpiece of Obama\u2019s plan is an attempt to narrow the loophole that exempts gun sales from background checks if the seller isn\u2019t a federal registered dealer. With new federal \u201cguidance,\u201d the administration is clarifying that even those who sell just a few weapons at gun shows, flea markets or online can be deemed dealers and required to conduct checks on prospective buyers. \u000aWhether that step can make a significant dent in unregulated gun sales is an open question, and one not easily answered. \u000aMillions of guns are sold annually in informal settings outside of gun shops, including many through private sales arranged online. But the Obama administration acknowledged it couldn\u2019t quantify how many gun sales would be newly subjected to background checks, nor how many currently unregistered gun sellers would have to obtain a license. \u000aEasily reversible by a future president, the government\u2019s guidance to gun sellers lacks the legal oomph of a new law, such as the one Obama and likeminded lawmakers tried but failed to pass in 2013. The Justice Department said online the guidance \u201chas no regulatory effect and is not intended to create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits in any matter, case, or proceeding.\u201d \u000aWhat\u2019s more, none of the steps would have probably prevented any of the recent mass shootings that Obama invoked in the East Room: Aurora, Oak Creek, Charleston, Newtown, to name some. But Obama defiantly rejected that critique, dismissing it as the tired trope of gun lobbyists who question \u201cwhy bother trying?\u201d \u000a\u201cI reject that thinking,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe maybe can\u2019t save everybody, but we could save some.\u201d \u000aHoping to give the issue a human face, the White House assembled a cross-section of Americans affected by searing recent gun tragedies, including former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Mark Barden, whose son was shot to death at Sandy Hook Elementary School, introduced the president with a declaration that \u201cwe are better than this.\u201d \u000aObama readily conceded the executive steps will be challenged in court, a prediction quickly echoed by Republicans. \u000aChuck James, a former federal prosecutor who practices firearms law at the firm Williams Mullen, said opponents are likely to challenge Obama\u2019s authority to define what it means to be \u201cengaged in the business\u201d of selling guns beyond what\u2019s laid out in the law. The White House asserted confidence Obama was acting legally, and said Justice Department and White House lawyers had worked diligently to ensure the steps were watertight. \u000aOther new steps include 230 new examiners the FBI will hire to process background checks, aiming to prevent delays that enabled the accused gunman in Charleston, South Carolina, to get a gun when the government took too long. \u000aObama is also asking the government to research smart gun technology to reduce accidental shootings and asking Congress for $500 million to improve mental health care. Other provisions aim to better track lost or stolen guns and prevent trusts or corporations from buying dangerous weapons without background checks. \u000aObama\u2019s announcement carved a predictably partisan fault line through the presidential campaign. \u000aHillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, both competing for the nomination from Obama\u2019s party, pledged to build on his actions if elected. The Republican field formed a chorus of voices vowing to annul the whole package, with Marco Rubio claiming \u201cObama is obsessed with undermining the Second Amendment.\u201d \u000a\u201cRather than focus on criminals and terrorists, he goes after the most law-abiding of citizens,\u201d said House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican. \u201cHis words and actions amount to a form of intimidation that undermines liberty.\u201d \u000aAssociated Press writers Kevin Freking and Nancy Benac contributed to this report. \u000a

VWASHINGTON (AP) - President Barack Obama's plan to strengthen controls on guns in the U.S. is meeting swift resistance from gun rights groups, Republicans and even a few Democrats who say it's up to Congress to enact new policies on firearms. Yet the overall effect on gun violence could prove to be relatively small. \u000aSome questions and answers about Obama's presidential actions on gun control: \u000aWHAT ACTION IS OBAMA TAKING? \u000aObama announced a 10-point plan to try to keep guns from people who shouldn't have them. The centerpiece is new federal guidance that seeks to clarify who is "in the business" of selling firearms and has to get a federal license. \u000aLicensed dealers must run background checks on prospective buyers, but private sellers don't. Obama is aiming to narrow that loophole so that more firearms sold at gun shows, flea markets or online are subject to background checks. \u000aOther steps include 230 new examiners the FBI will hire to process background checks. And Obama is directing federal agencies to research smart gun technology to reduce accidental shootings and asking Congress for $500 million for mental health care. Further steps aim to better track lost guns and prevent trusts or corporations from buying dangerous weapons without background checks. \u000aI SELL A FEW GUNS FROM TIME TO TIME. DO I NEED TO REGISTER? \u000aThere's no cut-and-dry answer. \u000aThe new guidance says if your "principal motive" is profit, you're a dealer, but if you occasionally sell guns from your personal collection, you're not. Someone who only sells at gun shows or online can still be a dealer. \u000aThere's no specific number of guns that triggers a requirement to register. But the Justice Department is warning sellers that courts have convicted people for dealing without a license even when they've sold as few as two guns. \u000aIt's up to individuals to look at the guidance and determine whether they need a license. The penalties for making the wrong call are steep: up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for those who deal firearms without a license. If you're not sure, you can contact the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \u000aWOULD THIS HAVE STOPPED RECENT MASS SHOOTINGS? \u000aAn Associated Press review shows that Obama's executive actions would have had no impact in keeping weapons from suspects in several of the deadliest incidents, including Newtown, Connecticut; San Bernardino, California; and Aurora, Colorado. The shooters in Newtown and San Bernardino, for example, used weapons purchased by other people. \u000aObama's actions could potentially reduce other gun deaths - especially suicides, which cause two-thirds of gun deaths. But it's unclear whether the steps will significantly curb unregulated gun sales. \u000aMillions of guns are sold annually in informal settings outside of gun shops, including many through private sales arranged online. The Obama administration acknowledged it couldn't quantify how many gun sales would be newly subjected to background checks. Nor could it say how many currently unregistered gun sellers would have to obtain a license. \u000aObama is running out of time. With barely a year left in his presidency, he has to act quickly to roll out new policies, especially if he wants them to become ingrained and harder to rescind when the next president takes over. \u000aAfter the Newtown shooting, Obama in 2013 sought far-reaching, bipartisan legislation that went beyond background checks to ban certain assault-style weapons and cap the size of ammunition clips. When the effort collapsed in the Senate, the White House said it was working to identify every legal step he could take on his own. \u000aBut a more recent spate of gun-related atrocities, including in San Bernardino, California, spurred the administration to give the issue another look. \u000aCAN THE PRESIDENT DO THIS ALONE? \u000aObama says he can. Republicans and gun rights advocates say he can't. \u000aThe White House says Obama is acting fully within his legal authority, by clarifying existing laws that Congress has already passed. It's an argument Obama has used before when opposition in Congress has led him to take sweeping executive action on immigration, climate change and other issues. \u000aStill, Obama readily concedes the executive steps will be challenged in court. One likely option for opponents is to challenge Obama's authority to define what it means to be "engaged in the business" of selling guns, since that definition isn't laid out in the law. \u000a

Yet the overall effect on gun violence could prove to be relatively small. \u000aSome questions and answers about Obama's presidential actions on gun control: \u000aWHAT ACTION IS OBAMA TAKING? \u000aObama announced a 10-point plan to try to keep guns from people who shouldn't have them. The centerpiece is new federal guidance that seeks to clarify who is "in the business" of selling firearms and has to get a federal license. \u000aLicensed dealers must run background checks on prospective buyers, but private sellers don't. Obama is aiming to narrow that loophole so that more firearms sold at gun shows, flea markets or online are subject to background checks. \u000aOther steps include 230 new examiners the FBI will hire to process background checks. And Obama is directing federal agencies to research smart gun technology to reduce accidental shootings and asking Congress for $500 million for mental health care. Further steps aim to better track lost guns and prevent trusts or corporations from buying dangerous weapons without background checks. \u000aI SELL A FEW GUNS FROM TIME TO TIME. DO I NEED TO REGISTER? \u000aThere's no cut-and-dry answer. \u000aThe new guidance says if your "principal motive" is profit, you're a dealer, but if you occasionally sell guns from your personal collection, you're not. Someone who only sells at gun shows or online can still be a dealer. \u000aThere's no specific number of guns that triggers a requirement to register. But the Justice Department is warning sellers that courts have convicted people for dealing without a license even when they've sold as few as two guns. \u000aIt's up to individuals to look at the guidance and determine whether they need a license. The penalties for making the wrong call are steep: up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for those who deal firearms without a license. If you're not sure, you can contact the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \u000aWOULD THIS HAVE STOPPED RECENT MASS SHOOTINGS? \u000aAn Associated Press review shows that Obama's executive actions would have had no impact in keeping weapons from suspects in several of the deadliest incidents, including Newtown, Connecticut; San Bernardino, California; and Aurora, Colorado. The shooters in Newtown and San Bernardino, for example, used weapons purchased by other people. \u000aObama's actions could potentially reduce other gun deaths \u2014 especially suicides, which cause two-thirds of gun deaths. But it's unclear whether the steps will significantly curb unregulated gun sales. \u000aMillions of guns are sold annually in informal settings outside of gun shops, including many through private sales arranged online. The Obama administration acknowledged it couldn't quantify how many gun sales would be newly subjected to background checks. Nor could it say how many currently unregistered gun sellers would have to obtain a license. \u000aObama is running out of time. With barely a year left in his presidency, he has to act quickly to roll out new policies, especially if he wants them to become ingrained and harder to rescind when the next president takes over. \u000aAfter the Newtown shooting, Obama in 2013 sought far-reaching, bipartisan legislation that went beyond background checks to ban certain assault-style weapons and cap the size of ammunition clips. When the effort collapsed in the Senate, the White House said it was working to identify every legal step he could take on his own. \u000aBut a more recent spate of gun-related atrocities, including in San Bernardino, California, spurred the administration to give the issue another look. \u000aCAN THE PRESIDENT DO THIS ALONE? \u000aObama says he can. Republicans and gun rights advocates say he can't. \u000aThe White House says Obama is acting fully within his legal authority, by clarifying existing laws that Congress has already passed. It's an argument Obama has used before when opposition in Congress has led him to take sweeping executive action on immigration, climate change and other issues. \u000aStill, Obama readily concedes the executive steps will be challenged in court. One likely option for opponents is to challenge Obama's authority to define what it means to be "engaged in the business" of selling guns, since that definition isn't laid out in the law. \u000a

VPresidential contenders split on party lines in their reaction to President Barack Obama's gun control actions Tuesday, with Democrats supporting Obama and Republicans vowing to undo his moves. \u000aTexas Sen. Ted Cruz was perhaps Obama's harshest critic, accusing the president of attempting to take away Americans' guns. \u000aOn Twitter, Cruz called Obama's actions -- which include expanding background checks on gun purchases and increasing funding for mental health and law enforcement agencies that perform those background checks -- "unconstitutional." \u000aIn an image included in the tweet, Obama was portrayed wearing a crown, alongside the message: "Gun control is government control." \u000aIt linked to a Cruz campaign website featuring Obama dressed in military-style garb, next to the headline, "Obama wants your guns." \u000aDonald Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said Obama is "making an end-run around the Constitution, trying to go directly to executive order and restrict one of the basic, fundamental principles of our country." \u000aFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted a link to an appearance on Fox News in which he characterized Obama's moves as "just one more way to make it harder for law-abiding people to buy weapons or to be able to protect their families. It's going to do nothing to prevent violence or crimes." \u000aFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, tweeted a link to his op-ed in an Iowa newspaper in which he said Obama's actions trample on the Second Amendment. \u000aRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson tweeted: "The President's actions have everything to do with advancing his political agenda & little to do with actually protecting American citizens." \u000aAnd former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee used Obama's speech to push for restrictions on abortion -- saying that Obama's case for saving lives should apply to that issue as well. \u000aDemocratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, vowed in New Hampshire on Tuesday that she will "take on that fight" and continue Obama's gun control push if she's elected. \u000aOn Twitter, in a tweet signed "-H" to indicate it was written by Clinton, rather than her staff, the former secretary of state thanked Obama "for taking a crucial step forward on gun violence. Our next President has to build on that progress---not rip it away." \u000aAnd her campaign highlighted Republican candidates' criticism of Obama's comments on its website, warning that a GOP president would undo Obama's actions. \u000aVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said in a statement that he, too, would keep Obama's actions in place if he's elected. \u000a"It's become clear that no mass shooting, no matter how big or bloody, will inspire Republicans to put children and innocent Americans over the interests of the NRA. They are simply more loyal to gun lobbyists than our children. That's why I support President Obama's executive actions to make our communities safer," Sanders said. \u000aAnd former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley vowed to build on Obama's actions. \u000a"As President, I will build on President Obama's progress by taking further executive actions to reform our gun laws. These include using the purchasing power of our federal government -- the biggest customer gun companies have -- to advance gun safety, banning 'cop killer' ammunition, declaring blanket immunity for gun dealers and manufacturers unconstitutional, and ceasing to defend the federal immunity law," he said in a statement. \u000a

VThe White House said that it has established the Internet Investigation Center , a program from the bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) that tracks illegal sales and shipments of firearms online. \u000aU.S. President Barack Obama became tearful Tuesday as he remembered the children who died in a mass shooting three years ago in Newtown, Connecticut. \u000a"I think that all guns should be, whether it's a shotgun, rifle, whatever, it should be at least 90 days", said Richardson. He says it would help reduce gun violence by keeping guns off the streets. \u000aU.S. Rep. Sander Levin (D-Royal Oak) later called the moves "commonsense steps" to tackle a complex problem. \u000a"It is also up to Congress to exercise its responsibilities". \u000aBut legislation enacted in 2013 , in the wake of the Aurora movie theater shooting, already requires background checks for all private gun sales in Colorado, so Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said Obama's announcement will have little effect on Coloradans. More than an unrolling of these modest measures, Obama's speech seemed to be his last stand on an issue that has haunted his two terms in office. \u000aSome Utahns say the real issue lies with guns and mental health. But there is another point here as well. "He has chosen to completely circumvent the legislative process, ignore the Constitution, and infringe upon the rights granted to each and every citizen of the United States by the Second Amendment. \u000aHow did we get to the place where people think expanded background checks is an excuse to take away people's guns?" "The President's latest executive action violates the Constitutional mandate that Congress create the laws while the President only enforces them", Buck said in a statement. \u000aObama said the administration is also beefing up enforcement , streamlining the background check system, investing $500 million in mental health care and researching " smart gun " technology. \u000a"If the the president through these orders has over stepped his authority, I will take immediate action to restrain him". \u000aCan President Obama use executive action for gun control reform without getting approval or bypassing from Congress? \u000aThe president wants background checks for anyone that buys a gun. \u000aBut Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders embraced the president's initiatives. \u000aOverriding all of this, of course, is the mantra of opposition to gun control measures: If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. \u000a"First graders", the president said Tuesday, according to the New York Times , having to wipe his eyes before continuing. \u000aWhat about the Second Amendment? \u000a"Anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks , or be subject to criminal prosecutions ". \u000aMartinez: Everton have title potential \u000aRoberto will have to deal with exhausted players and a few key injuries for the Capital One Cup semi-final clash... We will let football make the decision, but the chance is there for him to make a major contribution. \u000a

VWASHINGTON (AP) - President Barack Obama's plan to strengthen controls on guns in the U.S. is meeting swift resistance from gun rights groups, Republicans and even a few Democrats who say it's up to Congress to enact new policies on firearms. Yet the overall effect on gun violence could prove to be relatively small. \u000aSome questions and answers about Obama's presidential actions on gun control: \u000aWHAT ACTION IS OBAMA TAKING? \u000aObama announced a 10-point plan to try to keep guns from people who shouldn't have them. The centerpiece is new federal guidance that seeks to clarify who is "in the business" of selling firearms and has to get a federal license. \u000aLicensed dealers must run background checks on prospective buyers, but private sellers don't. Obama is aiming to narrow that loophole so that more firearms sold at gun shows, flea markets or online are subject to background checks. \u000aOther steps include 230 new examiners the FBI will hire to process background checks. And Obama is directing federal agencies to research smart gun technology to reduce accidental shootings and asking Congress for $500 million for mental health care. Further steps aim to better track lost guns and prevent trusts or corporations from buying dangerous weapons without background checks. \u000aI SELL A FEW GUNS FROM TIME TO TIME. DO I NEED TO REGISTER? \u000aThere's no cut-and-dry answer. \u000aThe new guidance says if your "principal motive" is profit, you're a dealer, but if you occasionally sell guns from your personal collection, you're not. Someone who only sells at gun shows or online can still be a dealer. \u000aThere's no specific number of guns that triggers a requirement to register. But the Justice Department is warning sellers that courts have convicted people for dealing without a license even when they've sold as few as two guns. \u000aIt's up to individuals to look at the guidance and determine whether they need a license. The penalties for making the wrong call are steep: up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for those who deal firearms without a license. If you're not sure, you can contact the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \u000aWOULD THIS HAVE STOPPED RECENT MASS SHOOTINGS? \u000aAn Associated Press review shows that Obama's executive actions would have had no impact in keeping weapons from suspects in several of the deadliest incidents, including Newtown, Connecticut; San Bernardino, California; and Aurora, Colorado. The shooters in Newtown and San Bernardino, for example, used weapons purchased by other people. \u000aObama's actions could potentially reduce other gun deaths - especially suicides, which cause two-thirds of gun deaths. But it's unclear whether the steps will significantly curb unregulated gun sales. \u000aMillions of guns are sold annually in informal settings outside of gun shops, including many through private sales arranged online. The Obama administration acknowledged it couldn't quantify how many gun sales would be newly subjected to background checks. Nor could it say how many currently unregistered gun sellers would have to obtain a license. \u000aObama is running out of time. With barely a year left in his presidency, he has to act quickly to roll out new policies, especially if he wants them to become ingrained and harder to rescind when the next president takes over. \u000aAfter the Newtown shooting, Obama in 2013 sought far-reaching, bipartisan legislation that went beyond background checks to ban certain assault-style weapons and cap the size of ammunition clips. When the effort collapsed in the Senate, the White House said it was working to identify every legal step he could take on his own. \u000aBut a more recent spate of gun-related atrocities, including in San Bernardino, California, spurred the administration to give the issue another look. \u000aCAN THE PRESIDENT DO THIS ALONE? \u000aObama says he can. Republicans and gun rights advocates say he can't. \u000aThe White House says Obama is acting fully within his legal authority, by clarifying existing laws that Congress has already passed. It's an argument Obama has used before when opposition in Congress has led him to take sweeping executive action on immigration, climate change and other issues. \u000aStill, Obama readily concedes the executive steps will be challenged in court. One likely option for opponents is to challenge Obama's authority to define what it means to be "engaged in the business" of selling guns, since that definition isn't laid out in the law. \u000a

VWASHINGTON \u2014 It is axiomatic that congressional Republicans will oppose anything smacking of \u201cgun control,\u201d which may as well be read as \u201cYour mama.\u201d \u000aThus, it comes as no surprise that President Barack Obama\u2019s announcement of executive actions to clarify and enhance federal gun laws prompted reflexive, hyperbolic responses from the right. \u000aMarco Rubio said Obama is \u201cobsessed with undermining the Second Amendment,\u201d while Ted Cruz averred, \u201cWe don\u2019t beat the bad guys by taking away our guns; we beat the bad guys by using our guns.\u201d \u000aSpoken like a true, Canadian-born Texan who has been busy burnishing his \u201coutsider\u201d Outdoor Guy image. What\u2019s next? Cruz drinking the warm blood of a freshly slain (unarmed) beast? \u000aHouse Speaker Paul Ryan criticized the president for a \u201cdangerous level of executive overreach\u201d and for circumventing congressional opposition \u2014 as though Congress has been working feverishly to reduce gun violence. Rather, Republicans focus their laser beams on Obama\u2019s and the Democratic Party\u2019s political motivations, shocking to none, and remind us that we already have enough gun laws. \u000aThis may well be true, but couldn\u2019t we stand to tweak them a bit? Or, perhaps, enforce them? And, isn\u2019t it possible to reduce the number of guns in the wrong hands without surrendering our Second Amendment rights or invoking the slippery slope of government confiscation? \u000aOf course it is \u2014 and we can. \u000aObama made an artful and poignant counterargument to the usual objections Tuesday during a news conference from the White House. He reminded those gathered, including many who have lost family members to gun violence, that other people also have rights \u2014 the right to free assembly or the right to practice their religion without being shot. \u000aIn fairness to the gun lobby, which may not deserve such charity, one can understand reservations about limiting access to guns. What is less easily understood is the refusal of Republicans to take the reins of any given issue and do something constructive rather than invariably waiting to be forced into the ignoble position of \u201cno.\u201d \u000aIt is one thing to be in the pocket of the National Rifle Association. It is another to do nothing and then assume a superior posture of purposeful neglect, as though do-nothingness were a policy and smug intransigence a philosophy. \u000aThe steps Obama is trying to take won\u2019t save every life, but they seem minimally intrusive and could have significant effects. Summarizing briefly, he\u2019s clarifying existing law and more tightly defining \u201cgun dealer\u201d in order to impose broader background checks; upgrading technology for improved information-sharing and safer guns; increasing relevant workforces to speed up background checks; and closing loopholes that have allowed criminals to buy guns online and elsewhere with a separate set of rules. Or no rules. \u000aGiving the FBI more resources to modernize its system will help. So will giving $500 million to mental health services aimed at keeping guns away from people determined to hurt themselves or others. \u000aRequiring shippers to report stolen guns will also be helpful \u2014 and investing in smart technology could be a game changer. As Obama said, tearing up at mention of the Sandy Hook shooting that took the lives of 20 first-graders, if we can keep children from opening aspirin bottles, surely we can prevent their pulling the trigger on a gun. \u000aAs to expanding background checks, only the criminal or the suicidal object to waiting a day or two before taking home a gun. And, if the government doesn\u2019t complete the process within three days, seller and buyer can proceed, anyway. \u000aWhat concerns most people, meanwhile, are those weapons, especially semi-automatics with large magazines, whose only purpose is to kill people. Many argue that no current law could have prevented any of the mass shootings in recent years, but is this sufficient justification for doing nothing when doing something could make a difference we may never know about \u2014 the child who didn\u2019t die because new technology prevented him from firing a pistol? The Islamic State-inspired terrorist who didn\u2019t murder holiday revelers because he failed an online background check? \u000aObama\u2019s actions won\u2019t go unchallenged, needless to say. And much political hay will be threshed, bundled and sold to Republican primary voters in the meantime. But GOP voters should be as skeptical of those ringing the gong of doom as they have been of Obama. In a civilized society, more guns can\u2019t be better than fewer. \u000aReach Kathleen Parker, Washington Post Writers Group columnist, at kathleenparker@washpost.com. \u000a

VPresidential contenders split on party lines in their reaction to President Barack Obama's gun control actions Tuesday, with Democrats supporting Obama and Republicans vowing to undo his moves. \u000aMore from KTUU \u000aTexas Sen. Ted Cruz was perhaps Obama's harshest critic, accusing the president of attempting to take away Americans' guns. \u000aOn Twitter, Cruz called Obama's actions -- which include expanding background checks on gun purchases and increasing funding for mental health and law enforcement agencies that perform those background checks -- "unconstitutional." \u000aIn an image included in the tweet, Obama was portrayed wearing a crown, alongside the message: "Gun control is government control." \u000aIt linked to a Cruz campaign website featuring Obama dressed in military-style garb, next to the headline, "Obama wants your guns." \u000aDonald Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said Obama is "making an end-run around the Constitution, trying to go directly to executive order and restrict one of the basic, fundamental principles of our country." \u000aFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted a link to an appearance on Fox News in which he characterized Obama's moves as "just one more way to make it harder for law-abiding people to buy weapons or to be able to protect their families. It's going to do nothing to prevent violence or crimes." \u000aFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, tweeted a link to his op-ed in an Iowa newspaper in which he said Obama's actions trample on the Second Amendment. \u000aRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson tweeted: "The President's actions have everything to do with advancing his political agenda & little to do with actually protecting American citizens." \u000aAnd former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee used Obama's speech to push for restrictions on abortion -- saying that Obama's case for saving lives should apply to that issue as well. \u000aDemocratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, vowed in New Hampshire on Tuesday that she will "take on that fight" and continue Obama's gun control push if she's elected. \u000aOn Twitter, in a tweet signed "-H" to indicate it was written by Clinton, rather than her staff, the former secretary of state thanked Obama "for taking a crucial step forward on gun violence. Our next President has to build on that progress---not rip it away." \u000aAnd her campaign highlighted Republican candidates' criticism of Obama's comments on its website, warning that a GOP president would undo Obama's actions. \u000aVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said in a statement that he, too, would keep Obama's actions in place if he's elected. \u000a"It's become clear that no mass shooting, no matter how big or bloody, will inspire Republicans to put children and innocent Americans over the interests of the NRA. They are simply more loyal to gun lobbyists than our children. That's why I support President Obama's executive actions to make our communities safer," Sanders said. \u000aAnd former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley vowed to build on Obama's actions. \u000a"As President, I will build on President Obama's progress by taking further executive actions to reform our gun laws. These include using the purchasing power of our federal government -- the biggest customer gun companies have -- to advance gun safety, banning 'cop killer' ammunition, declaring blanket immunity for gun dealers and manufacturers unconstitutional, and ceasing to defend the federal immunity law," he said in a statement. \u000a

VWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to strengthen controls on guns in the U.S. is meeting swift resistance from gun rights groups, Republicans and even a few Democrats who say it\u2019s up to Congress to enact new policies on firearms. Yet the overall effect on gun violence could prove to be relatively small. \u000aSome questions and answers about Obama\u2019s presidential actions on gun control: \u000aWHAT ACTION IS OBAMA TAKING? \u000aObama announced a 10-point plan to try to keep guns from people who shouldn\u2019t have them. The centerpiece is new federal guidance that seeks to clarify who is \u201cin the business\u201d of selling firearms and has to get a federal license. \u000aLicensed dealers must run background checks on prospective buyers, but private sellers don\u2019t. Obama is aiming to narrow that loophole so that more firearms sold at gun shows, flea markets or online are subject to background checks. \u000aOther steps include 230 new examiners the FBI will hire to process background checks. And Obama is directing federal agencies to research smart gun technology to reduce accidental shootings and asking Congress for $500 million for mental health care. Further steps aim to better track lost guns and prevent trusts or corporations from buying dangerous weapons without background checks. \u000aI SELL A FEW GUNS FROM TIME TO TIME. DO I NEED TO REGISTER? \u000aThere\u2019s no cut-and-dry answer. \u000aThe new guidance says if your \u201cprincipal motive\u201d is profit, you\u2019re a dealer, but if you occasionally sell guns from your personal collection, you\u2019re not. Someone who only sells at gun shows or online can still be a dealer. \u000aThere\u2019s no specific number of guns that triggers a requirement to register. But the Justice Department is warning sellers that courts have convicted people for dealing without a license even when they\u2019ve sold as few as two guns. \u000aIt\u2019s up to individuals to look at the guidance and determine whether they need a license. The penalties for making the wrong call are steep: up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for those who deal firearms without a license. If you\u2019re not sure, you can contact the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \u000aWOULD THIS HAVE STOPPED RECENT MASS SHOOTINGS? \u000aAn Associated Press review shows that Obama\u2019s executive actions would have had no impact in keeping weapons from suspects in several of the deadliest incidents, including Newtown, Connecticut; San Bernardino, California; and Aurora, Colorado. The shooters in Newtown and San Bernardino, for example, used weapons purchased by other people. \u000aObama\u2019s actions could potentially reduce other gun deaths \u2014 especially suicides, which cause two-thirds of gun deaths. But it\u2019s unclear whether the steps will significantly curb unregulated gun sales. \u000aMillions of guns are sold annually in informal settings outside of gun shops, including many through private sales arranged online. The Obama administration acknowledged it couldn\u2019t quantify how many gun sales would be newly subjected to background checks.

VWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Barack Obama's plan to strengthen controls on guns in the U.S. is meeting swift resistance from gun rights groups, Republicans and even a few Democrats who say it's up to Congress to enact new policies on firearms. Yet the overall effect on gun violence could prove to be relatively small. \u000aSome questions and answers about Obama's presidential actions on gun control: \u000aWHAT ACTION IS OBAMA TAKING? \u000aObama announced a 10-point plan to try to keep guns from people who shouldn't have them. The centerpiece is new federal guidance that seeks to clarify who is "in the business" of selling firearms and has to get a federal license. \u000aLicensed dealers must run background checks on prospective buyers, but private sellers don't. Obama is aiming to narrow that loophole so that more firearms sold at gun shows, flea markets or online are subject to background checks. \u000aOther steps include 230 new examiners the FBI will hire to process background checks. And Obama is directing federal agencies to research smart gun technology to reduce accidental shootings and asking Congress for $500 million for mental health care. Further steps aim to better track lost guns and prevent trusts or corporations from buying dangerous weapons without background checks. \u000aI SELL A FEW GUNS FROM TIME TO TIME. DO I NEED TO REGISTER? \u000aThere's no cut-and-dry answer. \u000aThe new guidance says if your "principal motive" is profit, you're a dealer, but if you occasionally sell guns from your personal collection, you're not. Someone who only sells at gun shows or online can still be a dealer. \u000aThere's no specific number of guns that triggers a requirement to register. But the Justice Department is warning sellers that courts have convicted people for dealing without a license even when they've sold as few as two guns. \u000aIt's up to individuals to look at the guidance and determine whether they need a license. The penalties for making the wrong call are steep: up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for those who deal firearms without a license. If you're not sure, you can contact the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \u000aWOULD THIS HAVE STOPPED RECENT MASS SHOOTINGS? \u000aAn Associated Press review shows that Obama's executive actions would have had no impact in keeping weapons from suspects in several of the deadliest incidents, including Newtown, Connecticut; San Bernardino, California; and Aurora, Colorado. The shooters in Newtown and San Bernardino, for example, used weapons purchased by other people. \u000aObama's actions could potentially reduce other gun deaths - especially suicides, which cause two-thirds of gun deaths. But it's unclear whether the steps will significantly curb unregulated gun sales. \u000aMillions of guns are sold annually in informal settings outside of gun shops, including many through private sales arranged online. The Obama administration acknowledged it couldn't quantify how many gun sales would be newly subjected to background checks. Nor could it say how many currently unregistered gun sellers would have to obtain a license. \u000aObama is running out of time. With barely a year left in his presidency, he has to act quickly to roll out new policies, especially if he wants them to become ingrained and harder to rescind when the next president takes over. \u000aAfter the Newtown shooting, Obama in 2013 sought far-reaching, bipartisan legislation that went beyond background checks to ban certain assault-style weapons and cap the size of ammunition clips.

VWashington, Jan 6 (IANS) US President Barack Obama on Tuesday unveiled some executive measures on gun control, including expanding background checks, calling for "a sense of urgency" about gun violence. \u000aAnybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks or be subject to criminal prosecutions, Obama said at the White House, joined by gun control activists and the families of gun victims. \u000aHe said his administration will hire more people to process background checks to make the system more efficient and add 200 more agents and investigators to ensure the "smart and effective" enforcement of gun safety laws, Xinhua news agency reported. \u000aThe administration will also invest $500 million to expand access to the treatment of mental illness across the country, he said. \u000aEvery year, more than 30,000 Americans lose their lives by guns, Obama said, adding that the US is "the only advanced country on the Earth that sees this kind of mass violence erupt with this kind of frequency". \u000a"We do have to feel a sense of urgency about it," he said. "In Dr (Martin Luther) King's words, the fierce urgency of now, because people are dying." \u000aObama became emotional and shed tears when he talked about the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, when 20 children and six adult staff members were fatally shot. \u000a"Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad," the president said, wiping away tears as he pleaded for citizens and lawmakers to be more resolute in preventing gun violence. \u000aObama's gun-control measures are seen as an attempt to sidestep Congress on an issue that is increasingly partisan. \u000aObama emphasised that the new measures are "actions within my legal authority that we can take to help reduce gun violence", calling on Congress to get on board with common sense gun safety measures. \u000a"The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage right now but they can't hold America hostage," Obama said. \u000a

VWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Tears streaking his cheeks, President Barack Obama launched a final-year push Tuesday to tighten sales of firearms in the U.S., using his presidential powers in the absence of tougher gun restrictions that Congress has refused to pass. \u000aThe president struck a combative tone as he came out with plans for expanded background checks and other modest measures that have drawn consternation from gun rights groups, which Obama accused of making Congress their hostage. Palpable, too, was Obama\u2019s extreme frustration at having made such little progress on gun control since the slaughter of 20 first-graders in Connecticut confronted the nation more than three years ago. \u000a\u201cFirst-graders,\u201d Obama said woefully, resting his chin on his hand and wiping away tears as he recalled the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. \u201cEvery time I think about those kids, it gets me mad.\u201d \u000aObama\u2019s 10-point plan to keep guns from those who shouldn\u2019t have them marked a concession by the president: He\u2019ll leave office without securing the new gun control laws he has repeatedly and desperately implored Congress to pass. \u000aAlthough Obama, acting alone, can take action around the margins, only Congress can enact more sweeping changes that gun control advocates say are the only way to truly stem a scourge of mass shootings. \u000a\u201cIt won\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen during this Congress. It won\u2019t happen during my presidency.\u201d But, he added optimistically, \u201ca lot of things don\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d \u000aThe centerpiece of Obama\u2019s plan is an attempt to narrow the loophole that exempts gun sales from background checks if the seller isn\u2019t a federal registered dealer. With new federal \u201cguidance,\u201d the administration is clarifying that even those who sell just a few weapons at gun shows, flea markets or online can be deemed dealers and required to conduct checks on prospective buyers. \u000aWhether that step can make a significant dent in unregulated gun sales is an open question, and one not easily answered. \u000aMillions of guns are sold annually in informal settings outside of gun shops, including many through private sales arranged online. But the Obama administration acknowledged it couldn\u2019t quantify how many gun sales would be newly subjected to background checks, nor how many currently unregistered gun sellers would have to obtain a license. \u000aEasily reversible by a future president, the government\u2019s guidance to gun sellers lacks the legal oomph of a new law, such as the one Obama and likeminded lawmakers tried but failed to pass in 2013. The Justice Department said online the guidance \u201chas no regulatory effect and is not intended to create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits in any matter, case, or proceeding.\u201d \u000aWhat\u2019s more, none of the steps would have probably prevented any of the recent mass shootings that Obama invoked in the East Room: Aurora, Oak Creek, Charleston, Newtown, to name some. But Obama defiantly rejected that critique, dismissing it as the tired trope of gun lobbyists who question \u201cwhy bother trying?\u201d \u000a\u201cI reject that thinking,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe maybe can\u2019t save everybody, but we could save some.\u201d \u000aHoping to give the issue a human face, the White House assembled a cross-section of Americans affected by searing recent gun tragedies, including former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Mark Barden, whose son was shot to death at Sandy Hook Elementary School, introduced the president with a declaration that \u201cwe are better than this.\u201d \u000aObama readily conceded the executive steps will be challenged in court, a prediction quickly echoed by Republicans. \u000aChuck James, a former federal prosecutor who practices firearms law at the firm Williams Mullen, said opponents are likely to challenge Obama\u2019s authority to define what it means to be \u201cengaged in the business\u201d of selling guns beyond what\u2019s laid out in the law. The White House asserted confidence Obama was acting legally, and said Justice Department and White House lawyers had worked diligently to ensure the steps were watertight. \u000aOther new steps include 230 new examiners the FBI will hire to process background checks, aiming to prevent delays that enabled the accused gunman in Charleston, South Carolina, to get a gun when the government took too long. \u000aObama is also asking the government to research smart gun technology to reduce accidental shootings and asking Congress for $500 million to improve mental health care. Other provisions aim to better track lost or stolen guns and prevent trusts or corporations from buying dangerous weapons without background checks. \u000aObama\u2019s announcement carved a predictably partisan fault line through the presidential campaign. \u000aHillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, both competing for the nomination from Obama\u2019s party, pledged to build on his actions if elected. The Republican field formed a chorus of voices vowing to annul the whole package, with Marco Rubio claiming \u201cObama is obsessed with undermining the Second Amendment.\u201d \u000a\u201cRather than focus on criminals and terrorists, he goes after the most law-abiding of citizens,\u201d said House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican. \u201cHis words and actions amount to a form of intimidation that undermines liberty.\u201d \u000aThe National Rifle Association, the largest gun group, panned Obama\u2019s plan and said it was \u201cripe for abuse,\u201d although the group didn\u2019t specify what steps, if any, it will take to oppose or try to block it. \u000a

VPresidential contenders split on party lines in their reaction to President Barack Obama's gun control actions Tuesday, with Democrats supporting Obama and Republicans vowing to undo his moves. \u000aTexas Sen. Ted Cruz was perhaps Obama's harshest critic, accusing the president of attempting to take away Americans' guns. \u000aOn Twitter, Cruz called Obama's actions -- which include expanding background checks on gun purchases and increasing funding for mental health and law enforcement agencies that perform those background checks -- "unconstitutional." \u000aIn an image included in the tweet, Obama was portrayed wearing a crown, alongside the message: "Gun control is government control." \u000aIt linked to a Cruz campaign website featuring Obama dressed in military-style garb, next to the headline, "Obama wants your guns." \u000aDonald Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said Obama is "making an end-run around the Constitution, trying to go directly to executive order and restrict one of the basic, fundamental principles of our country." \u000aFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted a link to an appearance on Fox News in which he characterized Obama's moves as "just one more way to make it harder for law-abiding people to buy weapons or to be able to protect their families.

VPresidential contenders split on party lines in their reaction to President Barack Obama's gun control actions Tuesday, with Democrats supporting Obama and Republicans vowing to undo his moves. \u000aMore from Central Coast News \u000aTexas Sen. Ted Cruz was perhaps Obama's harshest critic, accusing the president of attempting to take away Americans' guns. \u000aOn Twitter, Cruz called Obama's actions -- which include expanding background checks on gun purchases and increasing funding for mental health and law enforcement agencies that perform those background checks -- "unconstitutional." \u000aIn an image included in the tweet, Obama was portrayed wearing a crown, alongside the message: "Gun control is government control." \u000aIt linked to a Cruz campaign website featuring Obama dressed in military-style garb, next to the headline, "Obama wants your guns." \u000aDonald Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said Obama is "making an end-run around the Constitution, trying to go directly to executive order and restrict one of the basic, fundamental principles of our country." \u000aFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted a link to an appearance on Fox News in which he characterized Obama's moves as "just one more way to make it harder for law-abiding people to buy weapons or to be able to protect their families. It's going to do nothing to prevent violence or crimes." \u000aFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, tweeted a link to his op-ed in an Iowa newspaper in which he said Obama's actions trample on the Second Amendment. \u000aRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson tweeted: "The President's actions have everything to do with advancing his political agenda & little to do with actually protecting American citizens." \u000aAnd former Arkansas Gov.

VPresident Barack Obama today will unveil a package of executive actions to expand background checks for gun purchases, moves that will generate backlash from Republicans yet have only limited impact on the millions of guns circulating in the U.S. \u000aThe measures include tougher rules for those who currently sell firearms at gun shows and on the Internet without submitting buyers\u2019 names for criminal background checks, and a warning to sellers that they face criminal prosecution if they try to skirt the law. \u000aThe administration proposes hiring hundreds of new workers to modernize the background check system and to handle the additional requests for checks. In addition, Obama is requesting $500 million for new mental health research and the Department of Health and Human Services is clarifying rules to remove some of the barriers to reporting mental health status to the background check information system. \u000aThe initiative falls short of the broad changes in gun laws that Obama has called for in the past, which would require action by Congress. But it drew criticism even before it was previewed by White House officials Monday night. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, said in a statement that Obama \u201cis at minimum subverting the legislative branch, and potentially overturning its will.\u201d \u000aPotentially the most contentious piece of Obama\u2019s executive actions is broadening the definition of a gun dealer. The plan targets small-scale gun sellers, who may conduct transactions from home, a gun show or via the Internet and aren\u2019t required to hold a license or submit buyers\u2019 names for federal background screening. \u000aHowever, the expanded background checks wouldn\u2019t have blocked the sales of weapons used in most recent mass shootings, including the December terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, and the 2012 massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. The firearms in those cases were purchased legally through conventional outlets. \u000aResearch shows few of the guns bought from unlicensed dealers are sold directly to criminals. A study by the Justice Department found that just 0.7 percent of state prison inmates in 1997 had purchased their weapons at a gun show. By contrast, nearly 40 percent of inmates said they obtained the firearm used in their crime from family or friends, and 39 percent said they got the weapon from an illegal street source. \u000aThat\u2019s supported by a study released last year by researchers at the University of Chicago and Duke University, who surveyed inmates at Chicago\u2019s Cook County jail. They found that it was rare for criminal offenders to obtain guns through formal channels, with just one in 10 saying they had purchased the weapon at a gun store or pawn shop. Some 70 percent said they instead got their weapons through friends, family, or street connections, and that weapons had regularly passed through multiple owners. \u000a\u201cWhat they told us was that they were not buying their guns at flea markets or gun shows,\u201d said Philip J. Cook, a professor of public policy, economics and sociology at Duke\u2019s Sanford School of Public Policy who co-authored the study. \u000a\u201cTo the extent that continues to be the case, I would say the president\u2019s action in this area is not going to have much direct effect on criminal access to guns,\u201d he said. \u000aStill, Cook said the move could have an indirect effect on preventing gun deaths by disrupting the supply chain to the underground market. \u000aObama, who failed to get background check legislation passed after the massacre in Newtown, acknowledged the limits of what he can do without help from lawmakers. \u000a\u201cAlthough we have to be very clear that this is not going to solve every violent crime in this country, it\u2019s not going to prevent every mass shooting, it\u2019s not going to keep every gun out of the hands of a criminal, it will potentially save lives and spare families the pain and the extraordinary loss that they suffer as a consequence\u201d of gun violence, he said Monday after meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch, FBI Director James Comey and Thomas Brandon, deputy director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \u000aLynch said in a conference call with reporters Monday that it was \u201cimpossible to predict right now how many additional dealers will register.\u201d There has been a steady expansion of people seeking exemptions from the current rules in recent years, she said, as well as a notable increase in gun sales over the Internet. \u000aGun control advocates argue that any constraints on access to weapons will reverberate throughout the murky gun market that has been booming as the threat of new restrictions has made news. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the agency\u2019s National Instant Background Check System processed 23.1 million firearm background checks in 2015. That was 2.2 million more than the previous year, and an all-time record for the agency. \u000aWhite House officials argued the impact of the executive actions would be tangible. Press secretary Josh Earnest said that over the past 15 years, an average of 1,300 guns reported as lost or stolen had been recovered annually at crime scenes. The steps to tighten reporting could help reduce that number. And, the White House said, additional mental health screenings could help prevent suicides that represent two-thirds of the nation\u2019s 30,000 annual gun deaths. \u000aStill, the White House said more substantial progress could only be accomplished if legislation, opposed by groups like the National Rifle Association, allowed further gun controls and the collection of additional data. Even determining annual U.S. gun sales is difficult. Only a handful of gunsmiths -- including Smith & Wesson Holding Corp.; Sturm Ruger & Co., and Olin Corp. -- are publicly traded and disclose sales. \u000a\u201cThis doesn\u2019t move the needle as much as I\u2019d like, but it\u2019s a start,\u201d said Rep. Elizabeth Esty, a Connecticut Democrat whose district includes Newtown. \u000aShe and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy were among the Democratic lawmakers who met with Obama and Lynch on Monday and said Congress must step up with legislation. \u000a\u201cIt\u2019s beyond comprehension that Congress is turning a blind eye to the murder and mayhem in the communities we serve,\u201d Murphy said in a statement. \u000aThe moves are all but certain to draw a court challenge and a response from Republicans in Congress. Rep. John Culberson, a Texas Republican who chairs a key appropriations panel, sent Lynch a letter Monday warning he would \u201cuse every tool at my disposal to immediately restrict\u201d her department\u2019s funding if it proceeds with \u201cnew restrictions on our Constitutional rights.\u201d \u000aUniversity of Chicago law professor Eric Posner said Obama has the authority to issue a reinterpretation of an existing statute but can\u2019t run afoul of the Supreme Court precedent which holds that the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment guarantees people the right to bear arms for self-defense. \u000a\u201cHe has to interpret it in a reasonable way,\u201d Posner said of the president. \u201cHe can\u2019t just make up any interpretation.\u201d \u000a

VWASHINGTON \u2014 President Barack Obama's move to tighten controls on guns could curb the unregulated buying and selling of weapons over the Internet and at gun shows. But the overall effect on violence in the U.S. could prove to be modest. \u000a"It's not ever going to be difficult to get a firearm, just like it's not ever going to be difficult to get illegal drugs," said James Jacobs, a New York University law school professor. "What makes us think that we can now create a regime that will make guns hard to obtain for someone who wants to obtain them?" \u000aThe president used his executive authority Tuesday to clarify that anyone "in the business" of selling firearms must obtain a federal license and conduct background checks on prospective buyers, regardless of where the sales take place. \u000aCurrently, many private sellers online and at gun shows do not bother to get licenses, and weapons sales over the Internet have become a booming business. \u000aThe White House and others can't say how many transactions the step will block or how much bloodshed it may prevent. \u000aBut the new controls probably wouldn't have prevented many of the grisly mass shootings around the country that have led to demands for tighter gun laws, and may affect only a tiny fraction of the nation's 30,000 annual gun deaths. \u000aStudies in the last decade have shown that criminals are more likely to get guns directly from friends or other social connections than at gun shows or flea markets. \u000aThe president's action "has potential impact \u2014 the degree or the type, it's hard to predict," said University of Pennsylvania professor Susan Sorenson, who studies violence prevention. "And it's really important to acknowledge that we can't just have one change and expect that to change things wildly." \u000aThe president also called for the hiring of more than 230 additional examiners and other staff to process the millions of background checks received annually. \u000aYet even with added manpower, there's no way to completely eliminate human error like the clerical mistake that allowed Dylann Roof, the young man charged in the Charleston, South Carolina, church massacre, to buy a weapon even though he should have been disqualified because of a drug arrest. \u000aThe White House did not set a threshold for the number of guns someone has to sell to be covered by the licensing and background check requirement. But it warned that people can be charged with a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison for selling as few as two firearms when there is evidence they are running a business, such as selling weapons in their original packaging and for a profit. \u000aTheresa O'Rourke of Downers Grove, Illinois, said she hopes Obama's action will deter illegal transactions that have deadly consequences. Her best friend, 36-year-old Jitka Vesel, was killed in 2011 by a stalker who had illegally purchased a gun from a seller he met through Armslist.com , an online gun site. The seller was sentenced to prison after pleading guilty to an illegal sale. \u000a"People do it now because it's easy," O'Rourke said. "But if we say upfront that if you break the law and you are going to go to prison, most people are going to take a step back and say, 'You know what? It's not worth it.'" \u000aShe and other gun control advocates said too many individuals make a living selling guns without obtaining the $150 license and following requirements to conduct background checks, keep detailed sales records and face federal inspections. \u000aPrivate sales \u2014 often carried out in person after Internet advertisements connect sellers and buyers \u2014 can be exploited by convicted felons, domestic abusers and others who cannot pass a background check, critics say. \u000aPrivate sales have increasingly gone online over the last decade, but precise data is hard to pin down. GunBroker.com , which calls itself the world's largest online auction site for firearms and accessories, says it has grown every year since 1999. It now boasts 750,000 active listings on any given day. Armslist claims 7 million site visits per month. \u000aOne in 20 guns advertised through Armslist last year was linked to an unlicensed seller who had listed at least 25 guns, according to recent research published by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group backed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. A 2013 investigation by that group's predecessor, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, found that more than 3 percent of potential buyers on Armslist had criminal records that would bar them from owning firearms. \u000aArmslist, which was founded after Craigslist banned gun ads in 2007, says in a disclaimer on its website that it doesn't get involved in transactions and that buyers and sellers must follow all state and federal gun laws. Still, guns sold through ads on the site have been linked to some fatal shootings. \u000aA lawsuit filed in October alleges that an abusive husband purchased a handgun through an Armslist ad and used it to kill his wife and two other women at a salon in suburban Milwaukee in 2012. The man, Radcliffe Haughton, was able to buy the gun even though a judge had issued a restraining order days earlier that should have made him ineligible. He went online to say he was "looking to buy ASAP," and made the purchase in the parking lot of a McDonald's, the lawsuit says. \u000aArmslist owner Jonathan Gibbon called Obama's moves "well-meaning but ultimately ineffective." He said many private sellers want to conduct background checks but are discouraged by a "costly and burdensome" system that requires them to go to licensed dealers and pay fees. \u000a"Further scrutiny of law-abiding people will not stop criminals," he said. \u000aEverytown president John Feinblatt called the clarification a welcome if modest step. \u000a"It puts them on notice and, if accompanied with aggressive enforcement, has the potential to narrow the number of unlicensed dealers who are selling without background checks," he said. "But even so, millions of guns will be sold online without background checks unless Congress or states pass universal background checks, as 18 states have done on their own." \u000aThe Obama administration appeared determined to tamp down expectations, with Obama saying he realizes his actions won't stop all gun violence. \u000a"Obviously the president is not able to take strong measures because that's going to require Congress to act," said Philip Cook, a Duke University professor. "But if he is able to disrupt a relative handful of sales and save a handful of lives, that may well be worthwhile." \u000aHe added: "What we're looking at here is a low-cost intervention with the possibility of some payoff." \u000a

VCongress may react to President Obama's plans to curb gun violence by doing exactly nothing, in large part because Obama's action didn't do anything to change existing law, making it unclear what Congress should do in return. \u000aAs soon as President Obama announced plans to take executive action aimed at expanding background checks on gun purchasers, Republicans fired off statements opposing the move and threatening action. \u000aBut with few exceptions, the GOP didn't pledge any specific plans, and most lawmakers promised to study the changes while pledging to uphold the Second Amendment right to gun ownership. \u000a"Congress and the American people have repeatedly said 'no' to President Obama's ineffective policies that would infringe on the Second Amendment," Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said in a statement. "The House continues to stand for the Constitution and in defense of the American people's rights." \u000aMore from the Washington Examiner \u000aPolicy experts say the non-specific reaction is due in part to Obama's executive actions, which didn't change existing law, and instead stressed that appropriate background checks should be performed for all gun purchases, regardless of where they take place. But that's already current law, which makes it hard for Congress to respond. \u000a"All the president did was just restate what was in the statue, and court cases have interpreted it," David Kopel, a policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, told the Washington Examiner. "It's hard to have a counter measure against nothing." \u000aObama's action does imply a new effort to enforce current gun laws for smaller dealers, but it also implies a need for the hiring of more enforcement officers, something Congress could decide not to approve just by sitting on its hands. \u000aEven the GOP seemed to breathe a small sigh of relief Tuesday after days of anticipation Obama's proposal, which many believed would include prohibiting those on the notoriously faulty terror watch list from buying weapons. \u000a"The president's latest proposal," House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., acknowledged Tuesday, "does not go as far as originally reported." \u000aAlso from the Washington Examiner \u000aKopel said Republicans in Congress are more likely to attack a piece of Obama's action expanding the Social Security Administration. It would let the agency devise a rule to determine who is mentally incompetent, and to require that information to be reported to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which is used to block gun purchases. \u000aCritics of the move said it could result in the denial of gun ownership to people who are simply unable to manage their Social Security benefits but are not mentally ill. \u000a"This is not an issue that Congress can really avoid," Kopel said. "I think that is going to get a lot of attention." \u000aGoodlatte said the House Judiciary Committee would be examining the proposal. "I am concerned that it could impact citizens' privacy and due process by granting federal bureaucrats more power to take away this right from those it deems incompetent," he said in a statement. \u000aBut with the election year underway, Republicans are limited in legislative avenues to stop Obama. GOP leadership has shied away from spending fights over policy riders as the party strives to show voters they can govern without gridlock. \u000aAlso from the Washington Examiner \u000aTheir "no more government shutdowns" stance makes it unlikely Republicans will go so far as to pass legislation defunding Obama's move in the fiscal 2017 appropriations process. "It's something Congress clearly will not do," John Malcolm, a constitutional scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told the Examiner. \u000aOne GOP appropriator, Rep. John Culberson, of Texas, sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, warning that the House Appropriations Committee "will not provide resources" to the Department of Justice, for "unlawful limitations on the unambiguous Second Amendment rights of Americans." \u000aTop Republican leaders, however, haven't promised to use the "power of the purse" to stop the move. \u000aHouse Majority Whip Steve Scalise pledged to do "everything in my power to block any attempt by this president to restrict our Second Amendment rights," but he provided no specifics. \u000aRepublicans could instead use the judicial branch to try to stop changes they deem illegal. \u000aThe GOP has had some success in blocking Obama's executive actions. A federal court last Fall upheld a House Republican lawsuit over the Obama administration's payments to heath insurance companies participating in the Obamacare exchanges, for example. \u000aHouse Republicans could easily pass standalone legislation to stop the executive actions, but the measure would not likely pass the Senate and would be vetoed by the president. \u000aGun rights groups and red-state lawmakers said they opposed the new proposals. \u000aThe NRA, in a statement on Tuesday, warned that Obama's actions are "ripe for abuse," and accused him of of political exploitation. \u000aSen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, said the plan will "blur legal lines and intimidate individuals," seeking to legally purchase guns. \u000a"Rest assured," Cotton said, "Congress won't be ignored and I am committed to protecting your Second Amendment rights." \u000a

VHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday night that President Obama's attitude toward the Second Amendment is nothing short of "hostile." \u000a"It's clear he's hostile to the second amendment. There's no loophole here, he's just frustrated with the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens," Ryan told Fox News' Sean Hannity. \u000aThe GOP leader said aside from tightening gun controls, the president's executive action was also an attempt to divert the public's attention from his administration's record and fluster Republican members of Congress. \u000a"He wants to distract us also so that we are not looking at his failures, like a failure to confront radical islamic terror, a failure to defeat ISIS and he wants to get us off our game to offer a bold conservative agenda to the country," added Ryan. \u000aMore from the Washington Examiner \u000aGOP House members are 10 days away from their annual retreat. Ryan, only two months into his new gig, said his leadership team will explain how they plan to include everyone in the planning and carrying out of a "bold agenda" in the coming year. \u000a

VMembers of Idaho\u2019s congressional delegation reacted Tuesday to President Obama\u2019s executive actions aimed at preventing gun violence. \u000aAll Republicans, the elected members of U.S. Congress issued individual statements accusing Obama of overreach of executive power, disregard for Congress and the U.S. Constitution, and political grandstanding during an election year. \u000aU.S. Rep. Ral Labrador \u000a\u201cOnce again, President Obama has ignored the will of the American people and subverted our Constitution which gives Congress, not the president, the power to write our laws. When this president doesn\u2019t get what he wants, he acts unilaterally \u2014 as he has done repeatedly in the past on immigration, environmental regulation and Obamacare. Now, the President is putting election-year politics ahead of the Bill of Rights. I will continue to support the Second Amendment and fight the abuse of executive authority by this or any other president.\u201d \u000aU.S. Sen. Jim Risch \u000a\u201cThis president, more than any other, has violated the constitutional separation of powers in which the legislative branch enacts laws and the executive branch executes those laws. His excuse that the legislative branch is not doing its job could not be further from the truth. Indeed, the legislative branch continues to actively battle against and refuses to enact further gun control laws. That legislative function belongs to the first branch of government, not the second. \u000a\u201cI fully understand that the president and the left strongly disagree with Congress\u2019 refusal to further restrict the rights of law-abiding gun owners but that is the right of the Congress, and indeed, it is their duty and constitutional responsibility to the people who elected them. Those like the president, who want stricter gun laws, must do so by electing a pro-gun control Congress and not try unconstitutional lawmaking by the executive branch. Idahoans and Americans have steadfastly refused to elect a majority in Congress who favor stricter gun control. Americans have the right to do so.\u201d \u000aU.S. Rep. Mike Simpson \u000a\u201cI am disappointed but not surprised that President Obama is once again using executive orders to unilaterally push forward his personal agenda. \u000a\u201cThis administration pushes constitutional boundaries by implementing policies that should be considered, debated, and voted on by Congress. Limiting the ability of law-abiding citizens to exercise their constitutional rights to own firearms, will not address the crime problem. We should focus on improving the care of the mentally ill and enforcing the laws we have in place to ensure that they are kept out of the hands of violent criminals.\u201d \u000aU.S. Sen. Mike Crapo \u000a\u201cThe president\u2019s executive order to implement more gun control is just another brazen example of this administration\u2019s continued overreach, a repeated pattern of behavior by this administration. The president continues the pursuit of his broad agenda of command and control over many aspects of American\u2019s private lives. \u000a"This order makes it harder for law-abiding, responsible Idahoans to purchase firearms. The Second Amendment is unambiguous on the rights of citizens to keep and bear arms and I will continue to fight the president\u2019s efforts to restrict law-abiding citizens from exercising those rights.\u201d \u000a

VPresident Obama insists his executive action on gun violence is \u201cnot a plot to take away everyone\u2019s guns,\u201d but Republicans say otherwise. \u000aThe presidential campaign website for Texas Senator Ted Cruz boasts a warning that \u201cObama wants your guns,\u201d alongside a mock-up of the president in military garb. \u000aCruz\u2019s fellow candidate Marco Rubio called the president\u2019s plan unconstitutional saying, \u201cBarack Obama is obsessed with undermining the Second Amendment.\u201d \u000aHouse Speaker Paul Ryan accused Mr. Obama of a \u201cdangerous level of executive overreach.\u201d \u000aAnd Texas Republican John Culberson, whose subcommittee controls funding for the Department of Justice, threatened to cut the purse strings. \u000a\u201cIf the the president through these orders has over stepped his authority, I will take immediate action to restrain him. I\u2019m not going to wait for a court order. I\u2019m not going to wait for a lawsuit. Our Second Amendment right rights are too precious,\u201d said Culberson. \u000aThe National Rifle Association reacted to the president\u2019s remarks with a hail of tweets in real time. \u000a\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s executive orders will do nothing to protect public safety,\u201d the group insisted. The deep-pocketed group also issued a warning to any lawmakers thinking of siding with the president: \u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not good enough say \u2018I don\u2019t like what you\u2019re proposing.\u2019 Then bring forward your own proposals, but for God\u2019s sake, do something,\u201d Esty continued. \u000aMany Congressional Democrats applauded President Obama, but they don\u2019t control congress. The president can\u2019t get funding for new ATF agents unless he can win over Republican, something that seems unlikely right now. \u000a\u201cSadly, it\u2019s what I\u2019ve come to expect now,\u201d said Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty, a Democrat whose Connecticut district includes Sandy Hook Elementary, where 20 children and six adults were gunned down in 2012. \u000a

VWIPING back tears as he remembered children killed in a mass shooting, President Barack Obama on Tuesday ordered stricter gun rules that he can impose without Congress and urged American voters to reject pro-gun candidates. \u000aObama made it clear he does not expect gun laws to change during his remaining year in office, but pledged to do what he can to make gun control a theme in the months leading up to the November election to replace him. \u000aIn a powerful address in the White House, surrounded by family members of people killed in shootings, Obama's voice rose to a yell as he said the constitutional rights of Americans to bear arms needed to be balanced by the right to worship, gather peacefully and live their lives. \u000aObama has often said his toughest time in office was grappling with the December 2012 massacre of 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. \u000a"Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad," Obama said, tears rolling down his cheek. \u000a"That changed me, that day," he said, after being introduced by Mark Barden, whose 7-year-old son was killed in the shooting. "My hope earnestly has been that it would change the country." \u000aAfter that tragedy, the Democratic president failed to persuade Congress to toughen U.S. gun laws. He has blamed lawmakers for being in the thrall of the powerful National Rifle Association gun lobby group. \u000aObama, comparing the issue to the great civil rights causes of his time, is set to discuss gun violence again during a live televised town hall on CNN on Thursday, and during his State of the Union address next Tuesday. \u000aVice President Joe Biden is slated to do a series of television interviews on the topic on Wednesday. \u000aLEGAL CHALLENGES EXPECTED \u000aThe U.S. Constitution's 2nd Amendment gives Americans the right to have arms, a right that is fiercely defended. \u000aObama laid out executive action he is taking to require more gun sellers to get licenses and more gun buyers to undergo background checks. \u000aUnder the changes, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is issuing guidelines intended to narrow exceptions to a system that requires sellers to check with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine whether buyers have criminal records, are charged with crimes or have mental health conditions that would bar them from owning a gun. \u000aThe proposal is "ripe for abuse" by the government, said Chris Cox, an official with the NRA, in a statement, adding that the group will continue to fight to protect Americans' constitutional rights. \u000aLegal challenges to the changes, which are contained in guidance from the ATF, are expected. \u000aThe crucial question in any direct legal challenge will be whether the ATF guidance creates new obligations, or merely clarifies existing law. \u000aThe more the Obama administration acts as though the guidance has created a new legal requirement, the more legal trouble it might invite, said Lisa Heinzerling, administrative law professor at Georgetown University. \u000aThe stocks of gunmakers Smith & Wesson Holding Corp and Sturm Ruger & Co Inc have climbed since the announcement. On Tuesday, Smith & Wesson ended up 11.1 percent to $25.86 a share and Sturm Ruger closed up 6.8 percent at $65.54. \u000aREPUBLICANS VOW TO FIGHT \u000aRepublican leaders were quick to denounce Obama's gun changes, with most Republican candidates for the 2016 presidential race promising to reverse his actions if they win the White House. \u000aDemocratic candidates praised the moves. \u000aReince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, said the changes were "all about burnishing the presidents legacy and boosting Democrat enthusiasm in a presidential election year." \u000aRepublicans who control Congress made it clear that they oppose the changes, although some downplayed their significance. \u000a"Ultimately, this executive 'guidance' is only a weak gesture - a shell of what the president actually wants," said Kevin McCarthy, leader of the Republican majority in the House of Representatives. \u000aDemocrat Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia appeared to be in a minority in his party in voicing opposition to Obama's actions. \u000a"Instead of taking unilateral executive action, the President should work with Congress and the American people, just as Ive always done, to pass the proposals he announced today. \u000a"Like all law-abiding Americans and gun owners, I want to prevent future incidents of gun violence and keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill, but legislation and consensus is the correct approach, Manchin said in a statement. \u000a

VWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Tears streaking his cheeks, President Barack Obama launched a final-year push Tuesday to tighten sales of firearms in the U.S., using his presidential powers in the absence of tougher gun restrictions that Congress has refused to pass. \u000aThe president struck a combative tone as he came out with plans for expanded background checks and other modest measures that have drawn consternation from gun rights groups, which Obama accused of making Congress their hostage. Palpable, too, was Obama's extreme frustration at having made such little progress on gun control since the killing of 20 first-graders in Connecticut confronted the nation more than three years ago. \u000a"First-graders," Obama said woefully, resting his chin on his hand and wiping away tears as he recalled the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. "Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad." \u000aObama's 10-point plan to keep guns from those who shouldn't have them marked a concession by the president: He'll leave office without securing the new gun control laws he's repeatedly and desperately implored Congress to pass. \u000aAlthough Obama, acting alone, can take action around the margins, only Congress can enact more sweeping changes that gun control advocates say are the only way to truly stem the frequency of mass shootings. \u000a"It won't happen overnight," Obama said. "It won't happen during this Congress. It won't happen during my presidency." But, he added optimistically, "a lot of things don't happen overnight." \u000aThe National Rifle Association, the largest gun group, panned Obama's plan and said it was "ripe for abuse," although the group didn't specify what steps, if any, it will take to oppose or try to block it. Even Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat and gun-owner who co-wrote the bipartisan bill Obama supported in 2013, took issue with the president's move. \u000a"Instead of taking unilateral executive action, the president should work with Congress and the American people, just as I've always done, to pass the proposals he announced today," Manchin said. \u000aThe centerpiece of Obama's plan is an attempt to narrow the loophole that exempts gun sales from background checks if the seller isn't a federal registered dealer. With new federal "guidance," the administration is clarifying that even those who sell just a few weapons at gun shows, flea markets or online can be deemed dealers and required to conduct checks on prospective buyers. \u000aWhether that step can make a significant dent in unregulated gun sales is an open question, and one not easily answered. \u000aMillions of guns are sold annually in informal settings outside of gun shops, including many through private sales arranged online. But the Obama administration acknowledged it couldn't quantify how many gun sales would be newly subjected to background checks, nor how many currently unregistered gun sellers would have to obtain a license. \u000aEasily reversible by a future president, the government's guidance to gun sellers lacks the legal oomph of a new law, such as the one Obama and likeminded lawmakers tried but failed to pass in 2013. The Justice Department said online the guidance "has no regulatory effect and is not intended to create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits in any matter, case, or proceeding." \u000aWhat's more, none of the steps would have probably prevented any of the recent mass shootings that Obama invoked in the East Room: Aurora, Oak Creek, Charleston, Newtown, to name some. But Obama defiantly rejected that critique, dismissing it as the tired trope of gun lobbyists who question "why bother trying?" \u000a"I reject that thinking," Obama said. "We maybe can't save everybody, but we could save some." \u000aHoping to give the issue a human face, the White House assembled a cross-section of Americans affected by searing recent gun tragedies, including former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Mark Barden, whose son was shot to death at Sandy Hook Elementary School, introduced the president with a declaration that "we are better than this." \u000aObama readily conceded the executive steps will be challenged in court, a prediction quickly echoed by Republicans. \u000aChuck James, a former federal prosecutor who practices firearms law at the firm Williams Mullen, said opponents are likely to challenge Obama's authority to define what it means to be "engaged in the business" of selling guns beyond what's laid out in the law. The White House asserted confidence Obama was acting legally, and said Justice Department and White House lawyers had worked diligently to ensure the steps were watertight. \u000aOther new steps include 230 new examiners the FBI will hire to process background checks, aiming to prevent delays that enabled the accused gunman in Charleston, South Carolina, to get a gun when the government took too long. \u000aObama is also asking the government to research smart gun technology to reduce accidental shootings and asking Congress for $500 million to improve mental health care. Other provisions aim to better track lost or stolen guns and prevent trusts or corporations from buying dangerous weapons without background checks. \u000aObama's announcement carved a predictably partisan fault line through the presidential campaign. \u000aHillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, both competing for the nomination from Obama's party, pledged to build on his actions if elected. The Republican field formed a chorus of voices vowing to annul the whole package, with Marco Rubio claiming "Obama is obsessed with undermining the Second Amendment." \u000a"Rather than focus on criminals and terrorists, he goes after the most law-abiding of citizens," said House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican. "His words and actions amount to a form of intimidation that undermines liberty." \u000aAssociated Press writers Kevin Freking and Nancy Benac contributed to this report. \u000a

VAP Photo/Carolyn Kaster President Barack Obama, joined by Vice President Joe Biden, right, speaks in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., about steps his administration is taking to reduce gun violence. \u000aThe question of the day revolves around whether an array of measures tightening control and enforcement of firearms in the U.S. rolled out Tuesday by President Barak Obama comport with the intent of the Second Amendment to the Constitution. \u000aIn short, they do. \u000aAs written, the Second Amendment guarantees citizens the right to \u201ckeep and bear arms\u201d as part of a \u201cwell-regulated militia.\u201d The argument that \u201cwell-regulated\u201d implies the lack of regulations is dubious on its face. Note, as well, that regulations are the realm of the agencies \u2013 overseen by the president \u2013 not the Congress, as so many will argue in the coming days and weeks. \u000aThe real question is whether Obama\u2019s clear attempt at a legacy-building guns initiative will have any real impact on gun violence and help to curb the epidemic of mass shootings we\u2019ve experienced in recent years. The answer is likely no. Despite that, it also is clear that some action must be taken. \u000aPredictably, gun-rights activists will decry the new purchase requirements announced Tuesday as dangerous infringements of their rights and gun control proponents believe the measures are too little and too late. \u000aIn the end, it would be best if both political parties could work together to examine the issue and find solutions that respect gun ownership while allowing fewer weapons in the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. When two of every three gun deaths are self-inflicted, it is clear that mental health is a key element to be addressed as U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., suggested Monday while in Aiken. \u000aThe rhetoric on this issue, like so many on the political landscape these days, is harsh, overblown and counterproductive when consensus should be the goal. \u000aObama accused the gun lobby of taking Congress hostage, but said \u201cthey cannot hold America hostage.\u201d He insisted it was possible to uphold the Second Amendment while doing something to tackle the frequency of mass shootings in the U.S. that he said had become \u201cthe new normal.\u201d \u000a\u201cThis is not a plot to take away everybody\u2019s guns,\u201d Obama said in a ceremony in the East Room. \u201cYou pass a background check, you purchase a firearm. The problem is some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules.\u201d \u000aAn emotional Obama wiped tears away from his eye as he recalled the 20 first-graders killed in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School. He paid tribute to the parents, some of whom gathered for the ceremony, who he said had never imagined their child\u2019s life would be cut short by a bullet. \u000aAt the centerpiece of Obama\u2019s plan is a more sweeping definition of gun dealers that the administration hopes will expand the number of sales subject to background checks. Under current law, only federally licensed gun dealers must conduct background checks on buyers. But at gun shows, websites and flea markets, sellers often skirt that requirement by declining to register as licensed dealers. \u000aAiming to narrow that loophole, the Justice Department\u2019s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is issuing updated guidance that says the government should deem anyone \u201cin the business\u201d of selling guns to be a dealer, regardless of where he or she sells the guns. To that end, the government will consider other factors, including how many guns a person sells, how frequently and whether those guns are sold for a profit. \u000aInvoking the words of Martin Luther King Jr., Obama said, \u201cWe need to feel the fierce urgency of now.\u201d \u000aObama\u2019s package of executive actions aims to curb what he\u2019s described as a scourge of gun violence in the U.S., punctuated by appalling mass shootings in Newtown, Connecticut; Charleston\u2019s Emanuel AME Church; and Tucson, Arizona; among many others. After Newtown, Obama sought far-reaching, bipartisan legislation that went beyond background checks. \u000aWhen the effort collapsed in the Senate, the White House said it was thoroughly researching the president\u2019s powers to identify every legal step he could take on his own. \u000aA more recent spate of gun-related atrocities, including the shooting in San Bernardino, California, have spurred the administration to give the issue another look, as Obama seeks to make good on a policy issue that he\u2019s elevated time and again but has failed until now to advance. \u000aFor now, these executive actions will become the law of the land. We can do better, and we must, to uphold the Constitution while confronting the carnage that gun violence so often creates in our nation. \u000a

VExecutive actions implemented by President Barack Obama, concerning closing the so-called gun show loophole, should not impact licensed gun shops much. \u000aThe plan, publicly announced by the president on Tuesday, will require anybody who sells a firearm at a gun show, flea market, website or other informal setting to hold a license and conduct background checks on customers. \u000aFederal law already requires licensed dealers, such as those with shops, to conduct background checks on sales. \u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s really going to change a lot of stuff,\u201d said Dennis Salem, owner of Sporting Goods Discounters in Richland Township. \u000aLin Karns, a sales clerk at Juniata Trading Co. in Everett, concurred, provided that, in his opinion, the president does not have a hidden agenda. \u000a\u201cIt really shouldn\u2019t impact us if that\u2019s the true thing he\u2019s going to do,\u201d Karns said. \u000aIn Pennsylvania, according to state law, a dealer must conduct a background check to sell a handgun at a gun show. The new federal guidelines would expand that to include all firearms. \u000aThe expansion, as brought on by the executive actions, are \u201cnot a plot to take away everybody\u2019s guns,\u201d but rather a tool to \u201creduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment,\u201d according to Obama. \u000a\u201cI think some of the laws he set forth are good ones because a convicted felon can\u2019t go to a gun show and buy a gun now,\u201d Salem said. \u000aObama, over the past few years, has also called upon Congress to implement new gun control measures. \u000a\u201cI think he has some other things in the works that could be big things,\u201d Salem said. \u000a

VThe area\u2019s two congressmen pointedly criticized President Barack Obama for using executive actions to narrow the so-called gun show loophole that exempts certain small firearm sellers from obtaining licenses and conducting background checks. \u000aU.S. Rep. Keith Rothfus, R-Sewickley, said the president \u201cis subverting our Constitution\u2019s separation of powers and is attempting to legislate from the Oval Office.\u201d \u000aHis colleague, U.S. Rep. Bill Shuster, R-Hollidaysburg, said. \u201cObama\u2019s attempt to infringe on the rights of millions of law-abiding citizens is truly reprehensible, and I will fight against this overreach every step of the way.\u201d \u000aCurrently, only licensed dealers must conduct background checks, per federal law, but many who sell firearms at flea markets or gun shows, on websites or in other informal settings do not register. Going forward, anybody \u201cin the business of selling firearms ... must get a license and conduct background checks,\u201d according to a fact sheet from the White House\u2019s press office. \u000aThe new guidelines will not apply to those who buy and trade as collectors. \u000a\u201cRewriting acts of Congress while undermining the Second Amendment is a bald attempt to criminalize the behavior of law-abiding citizens,\u201d Rothfus, from Pennsylvania\u2019s 12th district, said. \u000a\u201cInstead of blatantly disregarding the Constitution, the president must work with Congress to enact legislation to punish criminals, as well as to address the mental illness that consistently underlies horrible acts of gun violence.\u201d \u000aShuster, the 9th district\u2019s representative, alluded to recent acts of violence that drew national attention when elaborating upon his opposition to Obama\u2019s actions. \u000a\u201cWhether it is radical Islamic terrorists or mentally deranged individuals, one thing is clear \u2013 stricter gun control measures would not have stopped these tragedies from occurring,\u201d Shuster said. \u000aHe continued: \u201cWhile this action by the president may please some of his liberal supporters I fear that it will ultimately make my constituents feel less safe and set a dangerous precedent for even more anti-Second Amendment actions by the government in the future.\u201d \u000aWhen discussing ways to address gun violence, Shuster mentioned his support for the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act that, in his opinion, \u201cwould significantly reform our mental health system and increase treatment options for individuals that badly need help.\u201d \u000a

VU.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch (L) looks toward U.S. President Barack Obama during a meeting with top law enforcement officials to discuss what executive actions he can take to curb gun violence, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington January 4, 2016. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque \u000aPresident Obama is making one last attempt at enacting gun control legislation before his final term in office expires. \u000aAnd this time, he\u2019s not worrying about going through Congress to get it done. \u000aObama announced to the nation Tuesday his executive order to implement new restrictions without congressional approval in a speech that brought him to tears. \u000aThe main thrust of the White House plan is to expand background checks for buyers of firearms \u2014 a move long desired by liberals. An emotional Obama explained that even if his measures don\u2019t prevent the next mass shooting, they\u2019re still worth doing. \u000a\u201cEach time this comes up, we are fed the excuse that common sense reforms, like background checks, might not have stopped the last massacre. Or the one before that, or the one before that. So why bother trying?\u201d the president said. \u201cI reject that thinking.\u201d (RELATED: Obama Doesn\u2019t Care If His Gun Actions Can Actually Prevent Shootings) \u000aThe struggle for gun control, according to Obama, is just like the movements to abolish slavery and legalize gay marriage \u2014 meaning it\u2019s going to be a long battle to achieve the wide-ranging restrictions the Left would like to see placed on firearms. \u000aBut Obama promises his executive order will be a small step in the right direction to the type of gun control communist China has. (Yes, he did in fact cite the authoritarian state\u2019s lack of guns as something to aspire to.) \u000aWhat was so noticeable in the president\u2019s speech was the lack of any mention for what motivated the last high-profile shooting in America. San Bernardino wasn\u2019t caused by Syed Farook\u2019s assault rifles possessing him and his wife to go out and kill \u2014 it was caused by radical Islamic ideology. \u000aBy ignoring the motives for the shooting which serves as the direct impetus for his latest executive order, Obama is able to characterize it \u2014 and all other shootings \u2014 as a problem of Americans owning too many firearms. \u000aWhat liberals like Obama want to do is to fix that issue by ensuring fewer Americans have guns. To them, that development would entail a serious reduction in this country\u2019s violence, which implies law-abiding gun owners present a major threat to society. \u000aAnd, to liberals, they do. \u000aWhen reports first starting coming in about San Bernardino, the focus was immediately on crazed white men with guns rather than crazed jihadis with guns. Once it turned out it was terrorism \u2014 the kind the Left likes to gloss over \u2014 the focus remained firmly on guns and trotting out the \u201cwhite supremacists are more dangerous than Islamists\u201d line. \u000aThe point was clear: In spite of the brief interlude of homegrown jihad, we\u2019ve got to figure out a way to make sure the stereotypical person who own guns can\u2019t buy anymore. \u000aThat stereotype usually amounts to a white, rural, conservative male who\u2019s suspicious of the government and of the changing times. \u000aThe other top story in the news right now sheds light on how much the Left hates the idea of these people owning guns. \u000aWhile Obama was presenting his executive order, Oregon was still dealing with the worst act of terrorism since the beginning of mankind. Namely, a bunch of armed ranchers/militiamen who strongly resemble the gun owner caricature have occupied an empty building belonging to the federal government in the middle of nowhere. \u000aThe reason for this militia standoff relates to a complicated grazing dispute ranchers in the area have had with the feds. Though the stand-off appears it will probably be peaceably resolved with minor cost to both sides, liberals all over America have treated the isolated matter as one of grave importance \u2014 and they want these militiamen crushed. \u000aFormer talk show host Montel Williams demanded a \u201c shoot to kill \u201d policy in dealing with the Oregon outlaws. Several commentators have complained \u2014 without any relevant cases in hand \u2014 that if the militiamen were black or Muslim, they\u2019d already be dead by now. All said with an eyewink that those Oregonians should be in a morgue right now. CNN talking head and Daily Beast columnist Sally Kohn bemoaned the government\u2019s appeasement of the occupiers\u2019 \u201cterrorism\u201d and wished for swift and harsh justice to be dealt to the dissidents. \u000aIt\u2019s worth pointing out how harshly the feds dealt with white resisters in the 1990s at Waco and Ruby Ridge. (Or, as Kohn calls it, \u201c the Ruby Ridge Massacre in Waco, Texas.\u201d) The notion our government handles white \u201cterrorists\u201d with kid gloves is a fanciful, yet totally false notion. \u000aProgressives were probably actually quite pleased to have this story on their hands. Not only could it be exploited to deflect from Islamic terrorism, it could be used to argue for why certain people shouldn\u2019t have scary weapons. \u000aNow we can all pretend white men high on toxic masculinity and armed to the teeth are the primary threat to America and not radical Islam or urban violence. \u000aThe most important thing to realize about gun control is what it\u2019s actually trying to control. It\u2019s not guns or even really gun violence, but the archetypal gun owner. Liberals want him to give up the power that comes with owning a firearm and let the state and its nice progressive bureaucrats handle any issue he might have. (RELATED: Liberals Hate Police But Love Police States) \u000aTo put it another way, gun control is a power transfer between citizens and the state, and the state receives the better end of the deal. \u000aThere\u2019s a good reason why we have the Second Amendment \u2014 it gave citizens the ability to defend themselves, their family and their property with their own means. The 21st century Left doesn\u2019t want law-abiding folk to have that kind of power. \u000aAs Obama admitted in his announcement, the restrictions failing to curtail crime and violence doesn\u2019t matter in the long run. The unstated thing that matters is ensuring America becomes where the stereotypical gun owner can no longer be a gun owner, and their way of life is extinguished. \u000a

VHis proposals would not have stopped the sale of guns used in recent high-profile mass shootings. They may hurt fellow Democrats at the polls next fall. And they will immediately be challenged in court. \u000aSo why did President Barack Obama implement a series of executive actions on guns Tuesday with the very real chance that a Republican successor would repeal them next year? \u000aEmbarking on his final year in the White House, Obama is looking to solidify his legacy. He wants to claim credit for doing something, anything, to help solve one of America\u2019s most vexing issues, even if it\u2019s just symbolic. Besides, many Democrats are no longer shying away from the contentious issue now that public opinion polls show that Americans support gun restrictions by wide margins. \u000aBut it\u2019s more than that: Mass shooting after mass shooting has left Obama fuming. \u000aData curated by FindTheData \u000a\u201cLook at it from his perspective; this has got to be frustrating. There\u2019s little he can do,\u201d said George Edwards , a presidential scholar at Texas A&M University. \u201cBut when you\u2019re frustrated and you can\u2019t do anything else, you use the tools you have.\u201d \u000aEDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM \u000aObama\u2019s actions are much more modest than the ones he has urged Congress to pass with no success. \u000aHe will expand the number of background checks on gun purchases by requiring more sellers \u2013 including those at stores, gun shows and on the Internet \u2013to get licenses. He will direct officials to conduct more gun research , urge more domestic violence prosecutions, keep better track of lost guns and make it easier for states to share mental health information. \u000aUntil we have a Congress that\u2019s in line with the majority of Americans, there are actions within my legal authority that we can take to help reduce gun violence and save more lives. President Barack Obama \u000aAides and activists also say that Obama, once reluctant to speak about the issue, will use his last year in office to launch a yearlong campaign urging states and localities to do what they can to curb gun violence, which leads to 30,000 deaths in the United States each year. \u000aEDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM \u000a\u201cEvery time I think about those kids, it gets me mad,\u201d said Obama, who openly wiped away tears Tuesday when speaking about the 20 first-graders killed in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012. \u000aGun violence is one of the only issues that have led the usually unflappable president to show his emotions in public, from crying and cracking his voice to chastising lawmakers and leading a congregation in singing \u201c Amazing Grace.\u201d \u000aAt the White House on Tuesday, Obama surrounded himself with victims of gun violence, including former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in Arizona in 2011, and Jennifer Pinckney , whose husband, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, was killed in Charleston last year. They interrupted his speech several times to applaud, and after he listed the names of cities that had endured mass shootings, some in the audience uttered: \u201cToo many, too many.\u201d \u000a\u201cCan you imagine what this must be like for him?\u201d said Jo Comerford, campaign director for MoveOn , a liberal group that has advocated for background checks for years. \u201cHe feels these gun deaths personally as a father, as a husband, as a man, as a president. He was coming home to a promise he made himself \u2013 and the nation \u2013 that he wanted to get this done.\u201d \u000aBut while advocates for gun restrictions praised Obama, some privately wondered why he\u2019d waited until his final year to act. They have been asking him to impose similar executive actions for years, most forcefully after the Newtown shooting. \u000a\u201cA lot of these ideas existed for several years,\u201d acknowledged Tim Daly, director for campaigns, guns and crime at the Center for American Progress , a left-leaning research center that made similar recommendations in 2013 and has worked closely with the administration. \u000aWhite House officials repeatedly declined to say this week why Obama didn\u2019t act earlier. But a senior administration official who\u2019s knowledgeable about the process but isn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly said in December that some of the ideas under consideration now had been discussed in 2013 but \u201cdidn't get to closure\u201d for a number of reasons. \u000aEDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM \u000a\u201cThat was a sprint,\u201d a second official said. \u201cWhere we took a bunch of things that were out there and pushed them over the finish line.\u201d This time, the official said, \u201csome of these things are a lot more complex.\u201d \u000aEDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM \u000aThe timing of this announcement, in the eighth and final year of his presidency, demonstrates not only political exploitation but a fundamental lack of seriousness. Chris Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association\u2019s legislative branch \u000aDuring his first term, Obama avoided gun control , an issue that was unlikely to win him political points or bring him legislative success. \u000aBut after the Newtown shooting \u2013 which he describes as the worst day of his presidency \u2013 Obama implored Congress to act and signed two dozen mostly modest executive actions. After Congress failed to expand background checks, an angry Obama blasted lawmakers, calling it \u201ca pretty shameful day for Washington.\u201d \u000aSince then, the president has continued to visit with grieving families and has counseled communities torn apart by mass shootings. In October, after a shooting at an Oregon college left 10 dead, Obama told his aides to \u201cscrub\u201d the law to see whether more could be done. \u000aDemocratic political consultant Drew Lieberman said acting was a \u201cno-lose\u201d situation for Obama at this point in his presidency, when he has an eye on his legacy. \u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t get it done, he can be viewed as the guy who took a stand,\u201d he said. \u000aEDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE \u000aObama doesn\u2019t seem to mind that his announcement this week has pushed the hot-button issue to the front of the presidential campaign, even if it may hurt moderate Democrats in swing congressional districts. He said gun violence was \u201csomething we should politicize.\u201d \u000aObama will speak about gun violence in a prime-time town hall meeting Thursday night on CNN \u000aRepublicans accused Obama of overreaching yet again and vowed to challenge him in court, which could delay the actions until after he leaves office next January. Already, his 2014 plan to defer deporting millions of immigrants who are in the country illegally is on hold as a legal battle wages on. \u000aSeveral GOP presidential candidates have pledged to undo Obama\u2019s actions if they are elected. \u000a\u201cNo matter what President Obama says,\u201d said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., \u201chis word does not trump the Second Amendment.\u201d \u000a

VPresident Barack Obama might be firearms seller Rich \u201cBig Rich\u201d Johnson\u2019s most valuable salesman. \u000aWhenever the president speaks about tighter gun laws, sales spike at his West Scranton business, Big Rich American Sports Shop, as folks stock up on firearms and ammunition. \u000a\u201cHe\u2019s got everybody panicked by just speaking,\u201d he said jovially. \u201cThe more he talks, the happier I am.\u201d \u000aOn Tuesday, Mr. Obama announced plans to beef up gun control laws including universal background checks \u2014 meaning anyone trying to sell a gun would be required to have a license and run a criminal check on the buyer whether they sell from a store, a gun show stall or on the Internet. \u000aWhile the president\u2019s announcement that he will use executive authority has raised the ire of Second Amendment activists nationwide, the rules don\u2019t stand to affect retailers much except maybe to drive in more customers reacting to news of more stringent laws, several gun sellers said. \u000aArea shop owners told The Times-Tribune that a number of factors have driven up sales \u2014 markedly since a mass shooting took place in a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school in 2012 \u000a\u2014 including other mass shootings, acts of terrorism worldwide by terrorist groups like the self-proclaimed Islamic State and al-Qaida \u000aand the perceived threat that accompanies immigrants and asylum seekers from Latin America \u000aand the Middle East. \u000a\u201cPeople are buying guns because they\u2019re scared,\u201d said second-generation gun shop owner Mike Jones, who owns Northeast Firearms in Honesdale. \u000aFrom the road while heading to a gun show in South Carolina, Mr. Jones estimated that he sells about 1,500 guns each year. Before Newtown, he estimated selling only about 1,000 guns annually. \u000aMr. Johnson had a name for the reactionary uptick. \u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve noticed it now over the last seven years; we call it panic buying,\u201d the West Scranton native said. He explained that every time there\u2019s a national crisis involving violence or a politician starts talking about gun control, wholesalers typically struggle to meet demand, especially when the incident coincides with the year-end buying season. \u000aMr. Jones said he hadn\u2019t planned on heading to the gun show this week, but with wholesalers\u2019 inventories scraping the barrel bottom, he decided last minute to go in person to bolster his own inventory. \u000aA New York Times analysis of new gun permits shows gun sales this past December neared 1.6 million nationwide amid Mr. Obama\u2019s intensifying calls for more gun control after a deadly shooting in San Bernardino, California. \u000aIn the last 15 years, the peak in monthly sales was topped only in January 2013, the month following the Newtown shooting, when national sales crested 2 million, according to the analysis. \u000aCustomers increasingly are buying more guns for protection. Sellers are seeing more female customers as well, said Ed Piestrak, owner of Piestrak\u2019s Gun Shop in Newport Twp. near Nanticoke. \u000aWhen he stared in business 40 years ago, female customers would come into his shop twice a month or so. \u201cNow it\u2019s almost 30 percent of the people are ladies, maybe 40 (percent),\u201d he said. \u000aFor gun shop owners, the background check system works as it was intended. \u000aAbout once a month, an aspiring customer leaves Mr. Piestrak\u2019s shop in handcuffs because the instant background check system flags people who try to buy a gun while wanted by law enforcement. \u000aRecently, a 23-year-old pregnant woman tried to buy a gun, but law enforcement had been tipped that she might attempt to make an illegal straw purchase, meaning she tried buy it for someone else who has lost their rights to buy a gun, Mr. Piestrak said. She was arrested. \u000a

VWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to strengthen controls on guns in the U.S. is meeting swift resistance from gun rights groups, Republicans and even a few Democrats who say it\u2019s up to Congress to enact new policies on firearms. Yet the overall effect on gun violence could prove to be relatively small. \u000aSome questions and answers about Obama\u2019s presidential actions on gun control: \u000aWHAT ACTION IS OBAMA TAKING? \u000aObama announced a 10-point plan to try to keep guns from people who shouldn\u2019t have them. The centerpiece is new federal guidance that seeks to clarify who is \u201cin the business\u201d of selling firearms and has to get a federal license. \u000aLicensed dealers must run background checks on prospective buyers, but private sellers don\u2019t. Obama is aiming to narrow that loophole so that more firearms sold at gun shows, flea markets or online are subject to background checks. \u000aOther steps include 230 new examiners the FBI will hire to process background checks. And Obama is directing federal agencies to research smart gun technology to reduce accidental shootings and asking Congress for $500 million for mental health care. Further steps aim to better track lost guns and prevent trusts or corporations from buying dangerous weapons without background checks. \u000aI SELL A FEW GUNS FROM TIME TO TIME. DO I NEED TO REGISTER? \u000aThere\u2019s no cut-and-dry answer. \u000aThe new guidance says if your \u201cprincipal motive\u201d is profit, you\u2019re a dealer, but if you occasionally sell guns from your personal collection, you\u2019re not. Someone who only sells at gun shows or online can still be a dealer. \u000aThere\u2019s no specific number of guns that triggers a requirement to register. But the Justice Department is warning sellers that courts have convicted people for dealing without a license even when they\u2019ve sold as few as two guns. \u000aIt\u2019s up to individuals to look at the guidance and determine whether they need a license. The penalties for making the wrong call are steep: up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for those who deal firearms without a license. If you\u2019re not sure, you can contact the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \u000aWOULD THIS HAVE STOPPED RECENT MASS SHOOTINGS? \u000aAn Associated Press review shows that Obama\u2019s executive actions would have had no impact in keeping weapons from suspects in several of the deadliest incidents, including Newtown, Connecticut; San Bernardino, California; and Aurora, Colorado. The shooters in Newtown and San Bernardino, for example, used weapons purchased by other people. \u000aObama\u2019s actions could potentially reduce other gun deaths \u2014 especially suicides, which cause two-thirds of gun deaths. But it\u2019s unclear whether the steps will significantly curb unregulated gun sales. \u000aMillions of guns are sold annually in informal settings outside of gun shops, including many through private sales arranged online. The Obama administration acknowledged it couldn\u2019t quantify how many gun sales would be newly subjected to background checks. Nor could it say how many currently unregistered gun sellers would have to obtain a license. \u000aObama is running out of time. With barely a year left in his presidency, he has to act quickly to roll out new policies, especially if he wants them to become ingrained and harder to rescind when the next president takes over. \u000aAfter the Newtown shooting, Obama in 2013 sought far-reaching, bipartisan legislation that went beyond background checks to ban certain assault-style weapons and cap the size of ammunition clips. When the effort collapsed in the Senate, the White House said it was working to identify every legal step he could take on his own. \u000aBut a more recent spate of gun-related atrocities, including in San Bernardino, California, spurred the administration to give the issue another look. \u000aCAN THE PRESIDENT DO THIS ALONE? \u000aObama says he can. Republicans and gun rights advocates say he can\u2019t. \u000aThe White House says Obama is acting fully within his legal authority, by clarifying existing laws that Congress has already passed. It\u2019s an argument Obama has used before when opposition in Congress has led him to take sweeping executive action on immigration, climate change and other issues. \u000aStill, Obama readily concedes the executive steps will be challenged in court. One likely option for opponents is to challenge Obama\u2019s authority to define what it means to be \u201cengaged in the business\u201d of selling guns, since that definition isn\u2019t laid out in the law. \u000a
